<p>Ze Li</p>
<p>I am a senior media company manager working for Wong Yong and Zhu Chen magazine. After graduated from Cardiff University with a failed dissertation talking about frauds endlessly, lacking journalistic skills, I got an offer from Vancouver Film School for film production. I read The Guardian film reviews. I have applied for NYU Tisch school twice. I don't read entertainment news. I know a little about lightning and sculpting. Dr Richard Clayton from Cambridge Univeristy once gave me an interview. I had shortly stayed in print shops and then wanted to make my own weekly online channel. After that, I shot photos and shared them online with a moving workstation. I found that I hardly know any Americans though film making really needs Americans.</p>

#8-18-2018-BUSINESS- VW's CEO was told about emissions software months before scandal: Der Spiegel</p>
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) Chief Executive Herbert Diess was told about the existence of cheating software in cars two months before regulators blew the whistle on a multi-billion <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/exhaust_1">exhaust</a> emissions scandal, German magazine Der Spiegel said.</p>
Der Spiegel’s story, based on recently unsealed documents from the Braunschweig prosecutor’s office, raises questions about whether VW informed investors <u>in a <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/timely?q=timely">timely</a> manner</u> about the scope of a scandal which it said has cost it more than $27 billion in penalties and fines.</p>
<p><strong>VW's CEO was told about emissions software months before scandal: Der Spiegel</strong></p>
<p>FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) Chief Executive Herbert Diess was told about the existence of cheating software in cars two months before regulators blew the whistle on a multi-billion exhaust emissions scandal, German magazine Der Spiegel said.</p>
<p>Der Spiegel’s story, based on recently unsealed documents from the Braunschweig prosecutor’s office, raises questions about whether VW informed investors in a timely manner about the scope of a scandal which it said has cost it more than $27 billion in penalties and fines.</p>
<p>The Braunschweig prosecutor’s office was not reachable for comment on Saturday.</p>
<p>Volkswagen’s senior management, which has denied wrongdoing, is being investigated by prosecutors in Braunschweig, near where Volkswagen is headquartered, to see whether the company violated disclosure rules.</p>
<p>U.S. regulators exposed VW’s cheating on Sept. 18, 2015.</p>
<p>Responding to the magazine report, the carmaker <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/reiterate#reiterate__4">reiterated</a> on Saturday that the management board had not violated its disclosure duties, and had decided to not inform investors earlier because they had failed to grasp the scope of the potential fines and penalties.</p>
<p>Citing documents unsealed by the Braunschweig prosecutor’s office, Der Spiegel said Diess was present at a meeting on July 27, 2015 when senior engineers and executives discussed how to deal with U.S. regulators, who were threatening to ban VW cars because of excessive pollution levels.</p>
<p>Diess, who was VW’s brand chief at the time, became chief executive of Volkswagen Group in April this year. Volkswagen also owns the Scania, Skoda, Audi, Porsche, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini and Ducati brands.</p>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had found unusually high pollution levels in VW’s vehicles and was threatening to <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/withhold?q=withhold+">withhold</a> road certification for new cars until VW explained why pollution levels were too high.</p>
<p>Diess, who had <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/defect_2">defected </a>from BMW to become head of the VW brand on July 1, 2015, joined the July 27 meeting with Volkswagen’s then Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn to discuss how to convince regulators that VW’s cars could be sold, a VW defense document filed with a court in Braunschweig in February, shows.</p>
<p>Volkswagen on Saturday said both Winterkorn and Diess declined to comment given the ongoing proceedings. A spokesman for Martin Winterkorn declined to comment on Saturday. Winterkorn’s lawyer Felix Doerr, could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Following this meeting, Winterkorn asked Diess whether BMW too had installed “defeat devices” in its cars, Der Spiegel said.</p>
<p>In the United States, legal engine management software is described as an “<a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/auxiliary_1?q=auxiliary">auxiliary </a>emissions device” while the term “defeat device” is used to describe only illegal software.</p>
<p>Diess is said to have answered that BMW had not made use of such software, Der Spiegel said.</p>
<p>EVALUATE</p>
<p>Volkswagen said on Saturday: “The contents of the discussion, where Martin Winterkorn and Herbert Diess were present, cannot be fully reconstructed, because the <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/recollection#recollection__4">recollections </a>of the people who were present partially <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/deviate?q=deviate">deviate</a>.”</p>
<p>Volkswagen further said it was the task of authorities and courts to evaluate the conflicting statements and to assess whether individual witnesses were <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/credible?q=credible">credible</a>.</p>
<p>Diess and Winterkorn left the July 27 meeting taking a presentation with them, Der Spiegel further said.</p>
<p>A VW employee intervened and cautioned the managers that it would be better if they were not in possession of the presentation, Der Spiegel said.</p>
<p>Volkswagen said on Saturday the purpose of the July 27 meeting was not to discuss whether Volkswagen had broken U.S. law, but how to resolve the issue of whether new models would be given regulatory clearance.</p>
<p>Volkswagen argued that it had struggled to understand whether its software was in fact illegal, the defense document filed with the Braunschweig court shows.</p>
<p>On July 31, 2015 Volkswagen hired a law firm to help the company understand its regulatory troubles, and lawyers were unsure whether the software would be <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/deem#deem__4">deemed</a> an illegal “defeat device” in the United States, VW said in the court filing.</p>
<p>The court filing further said that Hans Dieter Poetsch, Volkswagen’s finance chief at the time, on Sept. 14, 2015 believed the potential financial risk from regulatory penalties tied to emissions would be around 150 million euros ($172 million).</p>
<p>Hans Dieter Poetsch is now Volkswagen’s chairman.</p>
<p>Volkswagen on Saturday reiterated that it had not violated disclosure rules and had informed investors in a timely manner about the financial scope of the scandal when it published an “<a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ad-hoc_1?q=hoc">ad hoc</a>” disclosure notice on Sept. 22, 2015.</p>
<p>Volkswagen said that although it had admitted to using defeat devices to regulators on Sept. 3, 2015 it had assumed that penalties would not exceed 200 million euros, based on the size of fines imposed against rival carmakers who had committed similar regulatory breaches.</p>
<p>Because the company had already <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/accrue#accrue__4">accrued </a>sufficient <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/provision_1#provision_1__11">provisions</a> for vehicle recalls to cover this amount, there was no need to inform investors that profits could take a further hit before September 2015, Volkswagen’s court filing said.</p>

<p><strong>#China Tower debut reveals costs of tech leadership</strong></p>
<p>HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China Tower’s <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/flotation?q=flotation+">flotation </a>shows the price of telecoms dominance. Shares of the infrastructure company opened flat in Hong Kong on Wednesday. The newly listed <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/entity?q=entity+">entity </a>commands a low valuation relative to its Western peers. It’s a <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/keen_1">keen </a>reminder of the cost of leading the global industry.</p>
<p>The company raised $6.9 billion from the initial public offering, giving it a roughly $28 billion market value. Stock was sold at a multiple of almost eight times its EBITDA in 2017. That’s a <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/steep_1?q=steep+">steep </a>discount to U.S. tower companies, American Tower and Crown Castle, which trade at nearer 22 times and 23 times <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/trail_2">trailing </a>EBITDA, according to Eikon.</p>
<p>Cheap valuations affect the rest of the industry too. The three state-backed carriers – China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom – trade on multiples below 3.5 times trailing EBITDA. By contrast, Verizon and T-Mobile are valued at around 7.1 and 7.8 times respectively, while Vodafone is less than six times.</p>
<p>The steep discounts are<u> in part</u> because Beijing wants the carriers to build out a world-beating 5G network, probably starting <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/earnest?q=earnest+">in earnest</a> around 2019. EY expects capital expenditure for the technology to reach 1.5 trillion yuan ($220 billion) between 2019 and 2025. The commercial <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/rationale?q=rationale+">rationale </a>is <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hazy?q=hazy">hazy</a>, and it’s uncertain if officials will allow companies to later charge consumers more to <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/recoup?q=recoup+">recoup </a>costs.</p>
<p>The concern for China Tower centres on its future <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/lease_1?q=lease+">lease </a>negotiations; current agreements expire in late 2022. The state-owned company may be strong-armed into cutting its exhausted customers – who also double as its part owners – a break on fees.</p>
<p>That’s what happened earlier this year when the most recent round of negotiations reduced costs for the carriers, shaving around 2.9 billion yuan ($425 million) off net income this year – more than forecast earnings of 2.2 billion yuan, Bernstein estimates.</p>
<p>It’s a reminder of the steep expense of China’s much-<a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/vaunted?q=vaunted+" >vaunted </a>ambition to lead in telecom technology. That prospect – and the security and commercial implications it might <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/entail?q=entail+">entail </a>– has <u>sent hearts racing</u> in Washington, New Delhi and elsewhere. China Tower investors may also feel their pulses quicken as the scope of that <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/endeavour_1?q=endeavour+" style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 10pt;">endeavour </a>becomes clear, <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/albeit?q=albeit+">albeit </a>for very different reasons.</p>
<p>Paddington review – charming and <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cheeky?q=cheeky">cheeky</a></p>
<p>4 / 5 stars 4 out of 5 stars.</p>
<p>This big-screen <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/outing?q=outing">outing</a> for Michael Bond’s <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/intrepid?q=intrepid">intrepid</a> <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ursine?q=+ursine">ursine </a>hero is a treat for grown-ups as well as kids</p>
<p>Here’s a nice surprise. The new CGI-live-action Paddington Bear could easily have been another <span style="color: #ff0000;">garish</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">cheapo</span> Brit-movie. Instead, writer-director Paul King (who has worked on The Mighty Boosh TV show) and co-writer Hamish McColl have created a charming and sweet-natured family film, full of <span style="color: #ff0000;">wit</span> and fun, <span style="color: #ff0000;">skewed</span> towards young children but cheekily <span style="color: #ff0000;">speckled</span> with <span style="color: #ff0000;">sly gags</span> pitched at the older audience.</p>
<p>After an origin myth sequence set in darkest Peru (incidentally packed with some outrageous<span style="color: #ff0000;"> campery</span>), our young, ursine hero arrives in England, to be adopted by the Brown family in their west London townhouse. It is updated from Michael Bond’s original tales from the 1950s and 60s. Well, updated a bit.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Fusty</span>-but-lovable Mr Brown is played with <span style="color: #ff0000;">relish</span> by Hugh Bonneville, making a cinematic return to a part of the world he last visited in Richard Curtis’s Notting Hill (1999), and it looks pretty much the same. Sally Hawkins is Mrs Brown; nice neighbour Mr Gruber is played by Jim Broadbent and Peter Capaldi is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">horrid</span> neighbour, Mr Curry. Julie Walters plays Mrs Bird, no longer the housekeeper, but a distant relative (who evidently doesn’t qualify for a first name). The villain of the piece is Nicole Kidman, giving it the full Cruella de Vil as a <span style="color: #ff0000;">sinister</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">taxidermist</span> called Millicent, <span style="color: #ff0000;">kitted out</span> in <span style="color: #ff0000;">dominatrix getup</span>, which I certainly don’t remember from the books.</p>
<p>Portobello Road and west London do look a bit <span style="color: #ff0000;">monocultural</span> and Mary Poppinseque at times, but the movie has a nice anti-Ukipper line in attacking Mr Curry’s <span style="color: #ff0000;">xenophobic</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">grumpiness</span> and<span style="color: #ff0000;"> resentment</span> of outsiders. It is a Christmas treat.</p>

<p>The first round of what U.S. President Donald Trump called “the most biting sanctions ever imposed” against Tehran went into effect on August 7. “Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States,” Trump continued, in a tweet posted that morning. An even more damaging second round of U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic, reinstated after Washington pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, is expected to take effect in November.</p>
<p>Yet economic pressure is not the only tool the United States and its allies are using to counter Iran. In recent months, the Trump administration has been quietly working to forge a new security alliance, with the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and Oman – as well as Egypt and Jordan, to counter what it views as aggressive Iranian expansion in the region. Tentatively known as the Middle East Strategic Alliance (MESA) – but already nicknamed “Arab NATO” by the international press ­– U.S. and Arab officials say the coalition is being planned in an effort to expand cooperation on counterterrorism, missile defense and military training, partly to address the security challenges posed by Iran and its proxies.</p>
<p>The basic concept of an Arab NATO, however, is structurally flawed, and stands little chance of success.</p>
<p>Unlike the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which was established on the basis of shared interests and a more or less common “strategic culture,” in the face of a shared Soviet threat, the Sunni-led countries that the Trump administration expects to join the new alliance disagree on fundamental matters, including the crucial question of how best to conduct relations with Iran. While Saudi Arabia and the UAE view Tehran as their greatest enemy and are fighting a protracted war against Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen, Kuwait and, especially, Oman have historically enjoyed peace, and periods of close cooperation, with Iran. While Muscat facilitated the secret negotiations between Iranian and American officials that ultimately produced the historic nuclear deal, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain have consistently opposed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the accord is formally known.</p>
<p>An even greater obstacle to the formation and effective functioning of an Arab NATO is the schism pitting the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain against Qatar. That crisis began in June 2017, when Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Manama decided to ostracize their tiny neighbor, cutting trade and diplomatic ties with Doha over its alleged support for terrorism and relationship with Iran. Qatar, notably, is home to the largest U.S. air base in the region, while Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest buyer of American weaponry; the crisis, therefore, put the United States in an awkward position vis-à-vis two of its most important Middle Eastern allies.</p>
<p>Officially floated for the first time by Trump during his 2017 trip to Riyadh, the idea of forging an Arab NATO seems to be an attempt at what has come to be known, in international relations, as “buck-passing.” In other words, by pursuing an “America First” foreign policy the Trump administration is trying to shift the responsibility for taking on Iran to its Arab allies. The administration appears to be intent on using the plan as a catalyst for profitable arms sales to those countries; hours after the U.S. president landed in Riyadh last year, he and Saudi King Salman signed a number of agreements, including an arms deal worth about $110 billion, effective immediately, plus another $350 billion over the coming decade.</p>
<p>But buck-passing is exactly what America’s Arab allies want, too, when it comes to countering Tehran. Unwilling or unable to engage with Iran directly, its Sunni rivals hope to persuade the United States and even Israel to do the heavy lifting for them. As one analyst pointedly put it, Saudi Arabia seeks to fight Iran “to the last American,” by luring it into a war with the Islamic Republic. This fundamental clash of perceptions and expectations at the heart of the concept does not bode well for the successful launch of an Arab NATO – especially given the irony that these plans are being mooted at the same time Trump has threatened to break with the original NATO if other allies don’t increase their military spending.</p>
<p>Lastly, is it far from clear how such an organization would go about confronting Iran in practice. A successful alliance might manage (as Israel has emphasized recently) to prevent Tehran from establishing a long-term military presence in Syria as well as defeat Shi’ite Houthis in Yemen and restore the ousted Saudi-allied President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to power or, more concretely, to set up a missile defense shield covering the wider Middle East.</p>
<p>But unless internal rifts between potential members are resolved and a political consensus on burden-sharing is achieved, the Trump administration’s plans for passing the buck to an Arab NATO are unlikely to become reality.</p>
<p><strong>The Welsh brand whose clothes are on sale at Topshop just a year after launching</strong></p>
<p>A Welsh clothing brand has achieved spectacular success on the high street – less than a year since launching.</p>
<p>Womenswear brand Sunshine Soul has this week launched in Topshop stores nationwide after already being picked up by Next.</p>
<p>Pieces from their spring/summer '18 collection were shown on Love Island and have also been worn by the show's presenter Caroline Flack .</p>
<p>Founded by couple Jiti and Jessy Ojla with the aid of brand creative coordinator Nia Lewis, they believe the colourful brand is filling a gap in the market.</p>
<p>“Sunshine Soul was only established last year so we are still in the very early days,” said Nia. “We felt there was a gap in the market for strong trend led knitwear brand.</p>
<p>“After looking at other fashion brands in the market we felt there was room for more of a positive and feel good brand that was more about a good attitude hence the name Sunshine Soul.”</p>
<p>Nia described the brand as “high quality garments at an affordable price”.</p>
<p>She said: “Sunshine Soul delivers expensive looking fashion at an affordable price tag. Our in house design team create on trend wardrobe staples and chic fashion pieces for young women.</p>
<p>“We are a small close knit team of eight, which includes merchandisers, designers, sales and marketing. Our ethos is work hard, be positive and create a brand we are all really proud of.”</p>
<p>Working from their Cardiff HQ in East Tyndall Street, the company likes to keep it local.</p>
<p>“Cardiff is very important to the company, Jessy was born and bred in Cardiff,” said Nia. “We all feel that Cardiff is such a great city, there is so much potential here to highlight and as the company has such strong roots in Cardiff, we try to keep anything from models to website design Welsh and like to show support to local businesses.”</p>
<p>The brand has this week launched its autumn/winter collection, which it said has 'taken inspiration from the playfulness of '70s pop culture and current trends'.</p>
<p>Nia added: “The collection features stylish co-ords and knitwear pieces in a strong colour palette of navy, mustard and burgundy.”</p>
<p>The evolution of the brand has now taken a huge step forward with the announcement that it will be available at selected Topshop branches nationwide.</p>
<p>“Launching in Topshop is such a dream come true for the whole team,” said Nia. “We are beyond excited to be launching within the most fashion led retail brand and even more so to be launching within our Cardiff homestore. And then hitting 12 stores across the UK, in which we have hired 12 brand ambassadors, one per store."</p>
<p><strong>Freddy David to appeal six year prison sentence for fraud</strong></p>
<p>Fraudster Freddy David is appealing against his six-year prison sentence for a massive Ponzi scheme, many of whose victims were from the Jewish community.</p>
<p>David, 49, was jailed last month after he admitted defrauding 55 people out of £14.5 million.</p>
<p>The Judicial Office confirmed to the JC that he had made an application for permission to appeal, although it is not yet clear whether the request will be granted.</p>
<p>A spokesperson said: “The next step will be for a single judge to consider whether to grant permission on the papers. If permission is granted it will then go to a full hearing in front of three judges. As yet there is no indication of any timescales.”</p>
<p>At his sentencing, David’s actions were described as “a fraud of the utmost gravity with a devastating effect on others.”</p>
<p>The court heard he used the money to fund his gambling habit, pay for family holidays and pay his children's school fees.</p>
<p>David's friends were among the victims.</p>
<p>He stood down as managing director at wealth management company HBFS Financial Services last year amid a police investigation into the fraud.</p>
<p>The victims invested between £20,000 and £750,000 in the scheme. The fraud ran "in parallel with legitimate HBFS business", police said.</p>
<p><strong>Left behind: How Venezuela crisis is tearing families apart</strong></p>
<p>According to United Nations figures, 2.3 million people left Venezuela between 2014 and up to June 2018. Thousands continue to flee.</p>
<p>With 7% of the population having left nearly every family has been affected.</p>
<p>Development charity Cafod, which forms part of Caritas International, has spoken to some of those left behind.</p>
<p>María Teresa Jiménez, 85</p>
<p>A retired seamstress and mother of nine, María Teresa Jiménez has watched five of her children and nine of her grandchildren leave Venezuela.</p>
<p>"I worked for 38 years as a seamstress, and it went very well, my children wanted for nothing. Now, we don't even have money for medicine," she says of the shortages which have hit Venezuela for the past years.</p>
<p>"Fortunately, I didn't have my children now, I had them at a time when they could succeed.</p>
<p>"I'm happy that my children are in a place where they don't face danger. I wish I were 20 years younger, so I could go with them."</p>
<p>Magaly Henríquez, 58</p>
<p>Magaly Henríquez is a mother of five. She has stayed behind while her two youngest children, María Eugenia, a special education teacher, and Junior, a businessman, have immigrated. "It is really painful," says Ms Henríquez.</p>
<p>"My son had so many dreams. He started a paint supply business (which was forced to close due to rising prices). My daughter was working two jobs, and that wasn't enough for her to survive here. Many of the teachers in Venezuela had to leave."</p>
<p>Junior has now found work in Peru as a physical trainer and María Eugenia works as a housekeeper.</p>
<p>"I grew up in a free Venezuela," says Ms Henríquez "We didn't have these limitations with money. We could afford things. We had what we needed to live."</p>
<p>Maribel Pérez, 62</p>
<p>Ms Pérez has been caring for her grandchildren Naile, 12, Naiberli, 7 and Naire, 13, for a month, after her daughter went to seek work in Colombia.</p>
<p>"She'd been looking for work for over two years and nothing. I told her to take advantage of the fact I still have the strength to look after them," says Ms Pérez.</p>
<p>"It's hard on the girls. They've had birthdays, graduations and their mum isn't there. But when she calls they just tell her not to worry that they are fine and love her very much."</p>
<p>School enrolment is fast approaching, and registration requires that each child submits ID photos. The photographs cost a little more than a quarter of the average monthly salary.</p>
<p>If she doesn't get the images taken the girls will not be able to go to school.</p>
<p>Father Cristóbal Domínguez</p>
<p>Fr Cristóbal Domínguez has seen a mass exodus of youth from his parish - in the first half of the year, 17 youth ministry members migrated.</p>
<p>"We suffered the loss of the entire parish choir, which was made up of young adults who migrated last December," he says.</p>
<p>"We're now trying to form a new choir, but the topic of conversation is always about what other countries they can go to, which one offers more opportunities.</p>
<p>"Sadly, many of them feel that to find brighter horizons their only option is to migrate."</p>
<p>Working alongside Caritas Venezuela, Fr Cristóbal's parish runs an "olla comunitaria", a soup kitchen providing food for more than 500 people every week.</p>
<p>With the new school year only weeks away, he fears that many classes will be without teachers as they will have migrated.</p>
<p><strong>DA goes head-to-head with SABC over Ramaphosa broadcast</strong></p>
<p>The SABC’s broadcast of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s late night announcement on land expropriation without compensation infringed on a section of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa’s (BCCSA) code of conduct, according to the Democratic Alliance.</p>
<p>This was the party’s main argument when it presented to the tribunal against the SABC on Wednesday after having filed a complaint to the BCCSA last month.</p>
<p>Section 13(1) stipulates that: “In presenting a programme in which a controversial issue of public importance is discussed, a broadcaster must make reasonable efforts to fairly present opposing points of view either in the same programme or in a subsequent programme forming part of the same series of programmes presented within a reasonable period of time of the original broadcast and within substantially the same time slot”.</p>
<p>The public broadcaster aired a pre-recorded video of Ramaphosa in July with the strapline that said, “President Ramaphosa addresses the nation”, which the DA says is deceptive because he was speaking in his capacity as ANC president and not as president of the republic.</p>
<p>READ MORE: DA tests SABC impartiality claim<br>
Ramaphosa was announcing the ANC’s support of amending section 25 of the Constitution to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation.</p>
<p>Following the broadcast, the DA accused the SABC of knowing that the address was of a “party-political nature” and said the video “reveals the ANC’s abuse of a state institution”.</p>
<p>The party then gave the national broadcaster a specified time frame to air a message from its leader Mmusi Maimane on land reform saying that “if the SABC is as impartial as they claim, they will air the clip.”</p>
<p>This clip was not aired in the time given but a DA spokesperson who was appearing on the Morning Live programme the following day was asked to respond to Ramaphosa’s announcement.</p>
<p>The SABC contends that it met its obligations under section 13(1) by allowing the party’s spokesperson to speak on Morning Live.</p>
<p>But the DA does not agree and says the SABC is in breach of clause 13(1) because it did not make an effort to air its video – which is an opposing view to the president’s land announcement – within a “reasonable” period of time of the original broadcast and on the same programme.</p>
<p>The party says Ramaphosa was “afforded more time, on a platform of significantly higher quality, to advance the ANC’s position.”</p>
<p>The DA has requested that the BCCSA “reprimands the SABC” and that the tribunal’s findings be broadcasted in order “to remedy the situation”.</p>
<p>In a statement, the party said it would not “stand by as the failing ANC administration continues to use the public broadcaster as its own personal mouthpiece, as the Zuma administration did.</p>
<p>“The SABC must remain impartial and provide balanced reporting and the DA will stop at nothing to ensure that the public broadcaster informs citizens without fear or favour.”</p>
<p>The BCCSA will give its judgement within two to three weeks.</p>
