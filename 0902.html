			<i>Guyana Goldfields has long grappled with grade problems at its Aurora mine, seen here.</i><p>
            Chinese state-owned gold companies are going after some of the most troubled gold companies in Canada, betting that their deep pockets, cheaper access to capital and long time horizons will pay off. <p>
            In the past few months, Zijin Mining Group Co. Ltd. proposed a $323-million acquisition of Guyana Goldfields Inc., and Shandong Gold Mining Co. Ltd. offered to buy TMAC Resources Inc. for $207.4-million. <p>
            Both Toronto-based companies are among the most beaten-down assets in the Canadian gold sector, with Guyana long grappling with grade problems at its Aurora mine and TMAC struggling for years with an underperforming mill at its Doris mine in the Arctic. <p>
            <font color="#ffffff" style="background-color:rgb(11,83,148)">“It has been a pattern,” Barry Allan, analyst with Laurentian Bank Securities Inc., said of the Chinese targeting the problem children of the Canadian gold mining sector. “Certainly the Chinese like deep value.”</font><p>
            The Chinese companies can afford to take their time betting on companies such as TMAC and Guyana Goldfields. Their time horizons are much longer than both publicly traded Western miners, whose investors typically demand quick turnarounds on acquisitions, and even private equity buyers who can afford to wait about six years for a return. <p>
            With access to the vast coffers of the state, Chinese buyers have ready access to cash for both the acquisition itself and the hundreds of millions of dollars in additional capital that are often needed to fix companies such as Guyana and TMAC. <p>
            <font color="#ffffff" style="background-color:rgb(11,83,148)">“Buying the asset is just a ticket to the dance. There’s still a lot more money to be thrown in,” said Jon Case, precious metals portfolio manager with Sentry Inc. “Not a lot of companies have that firepower.”</font><p>
            While the ore at TMAC’s underground Doris mine in Nunavut is high grade, the company’s mill has been problematic. Since Doris went into production in 2017, output has been consistently lower than expected and costs significantly higher than predicted, in large part because of the company’s decision to use an unconventional modular mill. <p>
            Close to $700-million is needed to rightsize TMAC, including the construction of a brand new conventional mill. <p>
            Guyana Goldfields, too, needs a big capital infusion. Last year, the company stunned investors by reducing its gold reserves by 40 per cent after an earlier geological model overestimated the amount of gold in the ground at its Aurora mine in northwestern Guyana. The cost to transition from the current open-pit operation to a higher grade underground mine is about $140-million. <p>
            <font color="#ffffff" style="background-color:rgb(11,83,148)">Rick Rule, chief executive officer of Sprott U.S. Holdings Inc., said the Chinese hold a major trump card when heavy capital expenditures are needed because their input costs are much lower than Western miners. That encompasses everything from raw materials, such as steel that they can source domestically, to cheaper labour costs and savings on using their own engineering firms.</font><p>
            Chinese state-owned firms can also raise money for mine construction on much better terms than junior Canadian miners. <font color="#ffffff" style="background-color:rgb(11,83,148)">Mr. Rule said they can borrow at interest rates as low as 5 per cent, compared to as much as the 15 per cent TMAC might be subject to.</font><p>
            If Shandong were to borrow the $680-million needed to fix TMAC, for example, its interest costs would be $34-million a year. TMAC, by comparison, would have to pay up to $102-million a year. Over three years, Shandong could save $204-million in financing costs alone. <p>
            <font color="#ffffff" style="background-color:rgb(11,83,148)">“The Chinese have a durable advantage in terms of both capital cost and cost of capital,” Mr. Rule said.</font><p>
            Before the TMAC and Guyana acquisitions can close, they must pass a security screening by the Canadian government. In April, Ottawa announced it would subject acquisitions by foreign state-owned firms to “enhanced scrutiny” in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. <p>
            If the government suspects either transaction could be a threat to national security, the deals could undergo a more thorough review under Section 25.3 of the Investment Canada Act.
            Canada has rejected large takeover deals on security grounds in the past, including the proposed $1.5-billion acquisition of construction company Aecon Group by China’s CCCC International Holding Ltd. in 2018. <p>
            This year, Ottawa has already given the nod to one large acquisition in the gold sector by a foreign buyer. <p>
            Last month, the federal government approved London-based Endeavour Mining Corp.‘s $1-billion takeover of Montreal-based gold company Semafo Inc. Since Semafo’s gold operations are located in West Africa, ostensibly the takeover presented little risk to Canadian national security. <p>
            Guyana Goldfields’ operations are also abroad – meaning on the surface, the acquisition by Zijin would not appear to be problematic. <p>
            TMAC’s operations by contrast are located not only within Canada, but also in a sensitive location from a national security viewpoint. The Doris mine is situated near tidewater in the Northwest Passage, a highly strategic shipping route connecting the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific. <p>
            China doesn’t own any territory in the Arctic but has referred to itself in the past as a “near Arctic” state. <p>

            中国国有黄金公司正在追逐加拿大一些最陷入困境的黄金公司，押注他们的财力雄厚，获得资本的成本较低以及长期的发展前景将会得到回报。<p>
            在过去的几个月中，紫金矿业集团有限公司提出以3.23亿美元的价格收购圭亚那金矿公司，山东黄金矿业有限公司提出以2.074亿美元的价格收购TMAC Resources Inc.。<p>
            多伦多的两家公司都是加拿大黄金行业中表现最差的资产之一，圭亚那长期以来一直在努力解决其Aurora矿的品位问题，而TMAC在其位于北极的Doris矿的表现不佳的钢厂中苦苦挣扎多年。<p>
            劳伦森银行证券公司（Laurentian Bank Securities Inc.）的分析师巴里·艾伦（Barry Allan）说：“这是一种模式。中国人瞄准的是加拿大黄金开采业的问题儿童。当然，中国人喜欢深厚的价值。” <p>
            中国公司有能力花时间在TMAC和Guyana Goldfields等公司上，他们的时间跨度要比公开交易的西方矿商长得多，西方矿商的投资者通常要求快速完成并购，甚至有能力买得起的私募股权购买者。等待大约六年才能返回。<p>
            由于可以利用该州庞大的资金，中国买家可以随时为收购本身以及获得修复圭亚那和TMAC等公司所需的数亿美元的额外资金获取现金。<p>
            Sentry Inc.贵金属投资组合经理乔恩·凯斯（Jon Case）说：“购买资产只是跳水舞的门票。还有很多钱可以投入。没有很多公司拥有这种火力。” <p> 
            尽管TMAC位于努纳武特（Nunavut）的地下Doris矿的矿石品位高，但该公司的轧机一直存在问题。自2017年Doris投产以来，产量一直低于预期，成本也大大高于预期，这在很大程度上是由于该公司的决定使用非常规的模块化轧机。<p>
            要使TMAC合法化，需要将近7亿美元，其中包括建设一个全新的常规工厂。<p>
            圭亚那金矿区也需要大量的注资，去年，该公司通过早期的地质模型高估了圭亚那西北部Aurora矿场地下的黄金量，使黄金储备减少了40％，从而震惊了投资者。从目前的露天开采过渡到更高品位的地下矿山大约需要1.4亿美元。<p>
            Sprott US Holdings Inc.首席执行官Rick Rule表示，在需要大量资本支出的情况下，中国人持有一张王牌，因为他们的投入成本远低于西方矿商，这与原材料（例如钢铁）相关联。可以从国内采购，从而降低劳动力成本并节省使用自己的工程公司的费用。<p>
            相比于加拿大初级矿业公司，中国国有企业还可以以更好的条件为矿山建设筹集资金，Rule先生说，他们可以以低至5％的利率借款，而TMAC可能高达15％的利率。<p>
            例如，如果山东要借贷6.8亿美元来修复塔马克，那么它的利息成本将是每年3400万美元，相比之下，塔马克每年将需要偿还高达1.02亿美元。仅此一项就可以节省2.04亿美元的融资成本。<p>
            Rule先生说：“中国人在资本成本和资本成本方面都具有持久的优势。” <p>
            在TMAC和圭亚那的收购完成之前，他们必须经过加拿大政府的安全审查。4月，渥太华宣布，将对外国国有公司的收购进行“加强审查”，以应对COVID-19大流行。<p>
            如果政府怀疑任何一项交易可能对国家安全构成威胁，则可以根据《加拿大投资法》第25.3条对交易进行更彻底的审查。<p>
            加拿大过去曾出于安全理由拒绝大型收购交易，包括中国CCCC International Holding Ltd.在2018年以15亿加元收购建筑公司Aecon Group的提议。<p>
            今年，渥太华已经同意了一位外国买家在黄金领域的一项大型收购。<p>
            上个月，联邦政府批准了总部位于伦敦的Endeavor Mining Corp.以10亿美元的价格收购总部位于蒙特利尔的黄金公司Semafo Inc.。由于Semafo的黄金业务位于西非，表面上看，此次收购对加拿大国家安全几乎没有风险。 <p>
            圭亚那金矿公司的业务也在国外-从表面上看，紫金矿业的收购似乎没有问题。<p>
            相比之下，TMAC的运营不仅位于加拿大境内，而且从国家安全角度来看也位于敏感位置.Doris矿山位于西北通道的潮水附近，西北通道是连接大西洋与太平洋的高度战略性运输路线。<p>
            中国在北极没有领土，但过去称自己为“北极附近”国家。<p>

			Scarcely a week went by had Billy Yin felt the need to take in more protein powder as his instant noodles and frozen food from Iceland had extra nutrients added: they are not toxic and disruptive. He thought that a win-win deal, men sucking each other’s dick, is the word amicable means.</p>
            The copycat phenomenon is a danger to which the media may be contributing. Far away from China’s rich media market, Billy Yin could still remember all the ads he got in Shanghai on his way to work and home. He had shunned the set meal: Debts∞=hotel+ McDoanld’s+ high speed railway. The ads in these three gave individuals less autonomy in their own lives. The customers rose in revolt because the billboard and screen owners behaved so bad.<p>

			Changbai mountain is located in east part of Northeast China, bordering North Korea and Russia. In autumn, its forests are colorful. From pine to perch, it is like telling a tale of talking trees. Tian Shan mountain is located in west part of Northwest China, bordering Russia, Kazakhstan. In autumn, its forests are colorful, which makes it famous for tourists.</p>
            萬歲通天中，契丹盡忠殺營州都督趙翽反，有舍利乞乞仲象者，與靺鞨酋乞四比羽及高麗餘種東走，度遼水，保太白山之東北，阻奧婁河，樹壁自固。</p>
            In May 696 AD, a minority group in northeast killed the officer and fought against the central government. Another minority group’s leaders crossed rivers to the east, conquered northeast of Mount Changbai, blocking the river and protecting its group in that area.</p>

            The soldiers are in the west of Tianshan. They look back to the east. They could see the moon rising from the mountains and the clouds.<p>
			<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2557" src="https://allenneptune.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gettyimages-1042292940-612x612-1.jpg?w=300&h=200" alt="gettyimages-1127996210-170667a" width="300" height="200" /></p>
            It is a poem by Li Bai in Tang Period.<p>
            The rivers originated from Changbai mountain begin to flow in summer. Woods are around smaller cities miles away from the mountain.<p>
            “The vegetation of the mountain slopes is divided into several different zones. At the top, above 2,000 metres, tundra predominates. From 1,700 to 2,000 metres, vegetation is dominated by mountain birch and larch. Below this zone, and down to 1,100 metres, the dominant trees are spruce, fir, and Korean pine.”<p>
            “Forests in the Changbai Mountains are the richest in northeast China. Low-elevation areas below 1,100 m support mixed stands of conifers and deciduous broadleaf trees. Conifers include Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis), fir (Abies holophylla), red pine (Pinus densiflora), and Japanese yew (Taxus caspidata ssp. Latifolia). Deciduous broadleaf trees include Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica), Tilia amurensis, ash (Fraxinus mandschurica), and dwarf birch (Betula ermanii). Plant species with a subtropical affinity also occur in these forests. Examples include woody climbers, native Chinese gooseberry (Actinidia spp.), or kiwi fruit, and “Dutchman’s pipe” (Aristolochia mandshuriensis). These lower elevation forests are similar and transitional to the surrounding Manchurian Mixed Forests ecoregion. Understory vegetation includes economically important, and in some cases much depleted, species such as ginseng (Panax ginseng), Manchurian wild ginger (Asarum heterotropoides), and Gastrodia spp. which is used as an analgesic.<p>
            The “dark conifer” forest zone at 1,100 to 1,900 m includes a species-rich assemblage of plants that trace their origins to Siberia, western Eurasia, Japan and the Korean Peninsula. The forest here is cloaked in moss and supports an understory of forbs, grasses, and ferns. At 1,100 to 1,500 m, the forest consists of spruce (Picea jezoensis, P. obovata), fir (Abies nephrolepis), and larch (Larix olgensis). At 1,500 to 1,900 m, the tree diversity declines to stands composed of Picea jezoensis and Abies nephrolepis with a reduced understory and dense moss layer. Subcanopy vegetation in the dark conifer forest includes maple (Acer ukurunduense), birch (Betula castata), mountain ash (Sorbus pohuashanensis), and poplar (Populus ussuriensis).<p>
            Alpine elevations support a variety of forb species. Exposed sites support meadow, but in favorable locations where snow protects exposed buds during winter, woody shrubs such as willow (Salix spp.), Vaccinium spp., Rhododendron spp., and dwarf rock birch (Betula ermannii) form a low groundcover.”<p>
            <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/pa0414">https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/pa0414</a><p>
            “Coniferous forests in the Tian Shan tend to be quite homogeneous. The system is dominated by the spruce, Picea schrenkiana, a tall tree with a narrow crown that may form single-species stands or may grow up through a layer of broad-leaved deciduous trees. At the lower elevations, spruce associates with aspen (Populus tremula), a pioneer of landslides and other disturbed sites. At higher elevations, the associated broad-leaved species include mountain ash (Sorbus tianschanica), willow (Salix xerophila), and several birch species including Betula tianschanica, B. verrucosa, and B. microphylla.<p>
            Landscape vistas reveal a park-like mosaic of cropped meadows, scattered shrublands, rocky outcrops and dense stands of narrowly conical, dark-needled spruce. Meadows serve as pastures in most locations and are dominated by the grasses Festuca spp., Poa spp., and Helictotrichon schellianum. In moist areas within the lower forest belt, a shrub understory grows beneath the forest canopy. Species here include Lonicera spp., Cotoneaster melanocarpa, Euonymus semenovii, Rosa albertii, and R. beggeriana. Some of these species are identical to those that dominate the adjacent shrub or steppe areas. In the upper forest belt, understory shrubs form “spruce thickets.” The shrubs found here (Juniperus turkestonica, J. sibirica, Caragana jubata, Salix spp., Dasiphora fruticosa, and Spiraea tianschanica) include many of the same species that comprise the alpine scrub vegetation at elevations above tree line. Where grazing pressure is high, pastures tend to acquire an increasing density of thorny, unpalatable shrubs like Lonicera spp., Rosa spp., and Berberis spp.<p>
            Grasses and forbs also occur in the forest understory. Some of the important species include the grasses Brachypodium pinnatum, Calamagrostis spp., Helictotrichon pubescens, Dactylis glomerata, Agropyron tianschanicum,and Poa nemoralis and the forbs Solidago virga-aurea, Mulgedium azureum, Doronicum altaicum, Senecio soongoricus, Crepis sibirica, Aegopodium alpestre, and Cerastium dahuricum.<p>
            Like the forests of the Himalaya, the middle-elevation coniferous forests here support diverse and luxuriant carpets of moss (Thuidium spp., Rhytidiadelphus spp., Hypnum spp., and other genera) in shady locations with understory vegetation adapted to low-light conditions (Pyrola spp. and saprophytic orchids like Corallorhiza innata).<p>
            The larch, Larix sibirica, is found in a few local areas in the extreme eastern part of the Tian Shan.”<p>

			Mistakes befell Tartarus under construction: explosion in B deck ended with death roll of workers. This would be his debut in estate market in china. He was not a rookie embarking on a new career. The insurmountable problem was government put a deadline on this government project. To get coups, he ran the project 24 h a day, with three switches who were local farmers sleeping on site or drinking, spending without sleep before work: a camera just showed water pouring into decks in such an accident. The design was industry leading, the complexity of building was boxes of tricks: they emptied an egg then put a city in. Alarms rang, gates closing, workers escaping, one could see others running under their feet through the narrow steel made paths and stairs. Rousing speeches should be given by the director, so some avoided to eat in the onsite catering. As one of the workers complained afterwards.  </p>
            Wheat Flour (Wheat Flour, Calcium Carbonate, Iron, Niacin, Thiamin), Garlic and Parsley Topping (30%), Water, Yeast, Salt, Flour Treatment Agent (Ascorbic Acid).<p> 
			Cheapskate is a miserly person. He agitated the water to mixed the spices well. Debunking the high fame of Chinese cooking, he used egg, chicken leg, prawns as the three things needed. In a symposium during a fluids tech conference, everyone was asked to bring some food. His gloves were white with blue stitching, which were made by himself. In the rare known French movie, a pair of swans were feeding by upending. The resources left in the river were dwindling to a trickle so they had to speed up the process of catching and eating. He was renowned for his ways of getting bargains at groceries and butchers. He wanted to express his feeling towards him who just trampled down his fence. The young men liked harsh, draconian, severe rules he put on them in their relationships. They ripened beautifully. Building up the organic farm had not been easy, says Mr Slave, who worked in the school’s garden, biting into one of the juicy green and red-flecked fruits. Through the teeming thoroughfares of central Paris the food company drove short but stocky young scientist who were among the loyalists to the slavery farm in Kent.<p>
			On a piece of plank laid his mixed seafood noodle. It was an entrenched idea that poached eggs are a symbol of breakfast. Chicken leg meat, mushroom, shallots, seaweed, the smell, heat, had gone beyond human perceptions. Every cell of his whooped for a bowl of noodle with a great topping. Now with great fortitude enduring his illness, Professor Muffin Tin was happy to see a too much version of the mixed seafood noodle made by Monica in long red dress. <p>

			Billy Yin never thought of owning a house, or being big. All he thought was clean his own ass, which means cover all the expense by himself and have a little savings. </p>
            He no longer used Weibo, where all bright young people microblogged. He felt old after years of working. He had to get married, raise children, be the angels. He caught up with a couple of Brazilian in covert garden’s empty Jamie Oliver’s restaurant once. The husband told him to visit south part of the country, not capital part. He boiled the water, making his instant noodles. What flavor? His favorite was… yes, without a colleague degree, he would have been wandering around like the receptionists, waiters, chefs, sellers… out of the expertise, people have no difference. Everybody has a cross to carry and their courses are different. He hardly knew if he could find the next sun. It was easy, the city of stars, open your eyes, stars are all there. Hopes are all there. While, winter blue, he found tears always in his eyes. </p>
            City of stars… he never thought about being famous… in the center of dessert, stars were very clear. His favorite flavor was the pork rib mixed seafood. Then he ordered McDonald’s 37 rmb beef burger which cost 100 to be delivered to the base’s military check point, scanned, checked, picked up at the door. </p>
            He had been used to frozen food and instant noodles. They were full of hopes. Though frozen food were not fresh and cheap, they means a lot. They means human invented fridges, freezers, spice blenders. He knew that Mr Muffin had green hills and small island in oceans. He himself had was the whole space with no oxygen. He could hold breath for five long minutes. He could not eat any fresh things for weeks. </p>
            Military food were, the 16 rmb stainless plate Billy Yin would never buy, with mushrooms, cookies, carrots and a cup of water, protein powder, fat, sugar, vegs, vatmine pills, blended in one like making a sauce in a food processor. Drink it. His coworker said. They are in French style. </p>
            Billy Yin got all he needed from the food. They decided to launch the rocket to Triton next week. He was taught how to wash clothes in the rocket, how to cook on the ship, and how to keep a good sleep. His sister skyped him one night, saying she was on the way back to Neptune and they would sell the houses their parents left them as she decided to marry the Swedish and make another passport for Billy Yin. That was a big news for Billy Yin. As a man, being given a benefit, was like he had been paralyzed for years. Accepted it, definitely yes. He counted his bank account, he had spent all on the trips to south Africa, Chile… if the government won’t pay quickly after they ended this moon project, he would borrow. And, better leave on the moon, Billy Yin hated the earth deeply. </p>
            Once again, he stuck in traffic. He brushed teeth, washed face, took the shower, changed on his best cloth of the day, took the car’s key, started the engine, threw files onto the seats, turned on the radio for Mr Muffin’s morning show. The car got jammed outside the loop, approaching the 1% unpopular rich guys’ territory. He began to shave. Sun got out from behind the buildings. Last night’s romance didn’t make him an angel, the girl left after sex in the car. He shouted at an unlucky guy who sent fliers through cars. He looked promising, handsome, in the river of young people in suits serving this company or that. </p>
            It won’t take years that he could create a family and travel to convent garden with his wife, telling other young man, travelling alone, which part of the country to visit. A war came and everything stopped. He began to hide in Shanghai and never send any explorers and messages again to the border of solar system. Travelling was no longer safe. This time, only this time, a military is involved, he dared to put himself in the desert to go to out space again. Just don’t. His dead parent told him to suffer and never revenge, nor even feel angry. That’s the best way for a young person to survive. </p>
            Je suis malade. In a warm summer evening. I’ve been speaking English since I was seven years old. We are going to talk through. Vou ce di si? Are you from here? Tu da fi. Absolutely. Nou son par du. We are lost. Love bird got lost. My wife has just said. Alloh, well. Guest wu sha shi? What are you looking for? Nou sha shong a restaurant called golden lion. </p>
            Mr Muffin called his friend A: hi, dentist… could you do teeth cleaning? Un fat, toot lis men… almost every week… ma fam to find again… je suis vu le monte she le… I’m going to show you it on the map… Chinese turned to believe in empty words… stories like Titanic, Great Gatsby made them exited. This year, I was writing about Mr Darcy, but I felt the writing process had always been disturbed. First is local brands’ reactions to home applications, medical, this and that. It’s like a prisoners’ fighting. By nature, Chinese are not good with medicines. So every effort made would be of no effects. </p>
            Mr Muffin called his friend B who went to gym often and was a body builder: … Should Mr Darcy be muscled, like man of men, Ben Affleck… is the spelling right? Women needs a person to carry things, a body guard… but men could not fulfill these needs… so women don’t need men any longer… and God’s punishment on men ends. Seductive as it could be, why should men be muscled, with so many money into the gym, just for a woman to eat him and live longer than him? </p>
            So a man is lonely. Mr Muffin called his friend C: in the whole universe I met you online… you are a house owner and I’m working in burgerking, checking my HIV yearly… could you be my companion for this journey of life? Mr Muffin was serious… and desperate… but the man was poor… he owned no land in the island and no private jet… Mr Muffin owned several islands to escape to and all food network’s ads… he knows that British loves money, not his ugly appearance and the distance between them…</p>
            He cried in a hot bath. Always tears in his eyes. His nerve system broke down. He felt nothing. He called his friend D who needed his warmth, hug and comforting. He left the next morning to his Apple like home in Hangzhou. His friend D moved and he lost his address, phone number in the coming busy days. Somewhere in another hot bathroom, his friend D cried too. </p>
            Mr Muffin felt pains. He called his friend E. His friend E’s father was a doctor specialized in that kind of pains. His friend E was nice looking, fat, lovely and big. Mr Muffin only loved two persons in the world, his long lost lover Zu and the Welsh man. This pain was from someone else. The man touched his backbone and was a business partner. He didn’t know his name but he noticed him in the crowd of dealers. They smelt each other. Then they had sex often but Mr Muffin refused to continue meeting as he could not sleep by the side of the man on bed. He was not religious but believed in these things. He went to churches. Then he lost a man who understood his pain and tiredness, the man who wanted to pay half of his Apple store like house’s bill. His heart broke into pieces and never recovered until the Welshman slipped in to heal him, and around when he was receiving curses from the darkness. My wife, when the light that used to guide me faded away, you came out. Thank you. Thank you. All the poems are not for you, they are for the man I have lost. He asked if god could bring the man back… god said no. </p>
            Thousands of Chinese were fleeing from war zone to Shandong. The caravan of thousands of refugees was making its way towards the Sea through Shandong province. Security guards made regular patrols at night but refugees were climbing over the fences. Death roll ramped up. The employment if refugees was mooted in a crowded border city’s city council. They decided to recruit the war victims into a farm monetizing from church properties. Special economic zone controlled by gangs was filled by people with cars rushing into the sea. The decline of oil supplies this year follows exponential growth of oil price in the past few years. More car owners committed suicides. When they jointed the evolution, the new government promised them with land distribution. While, in Sicily, the small special economic zone, the poorest didn’t get what they want. Still, the rich lived in city center with flashy mansions and cars. The poor starve and struggled in city fringes. This city reminded us every minute who we were and which parts we were living in. More people committed suicides and would like to do so, the figures were obtained by extrapolating from past trends, which spooked investors. Though Shandong was faring better than its peers, its regaining momentum of economy was unknown. Market volatility, goods blocked during transportation, all there were just small results of a big government falling down. </p>
            Something that should not be forgotten was lost. “…materilxpaths,” one of Mr Muffin’s employees spoke he spell to sculptures, hastening the releasing of a deeper war. Many reported the cars were autonomous. The truth was they were dispersed from M14 to M16, then into the sea. A United Nations aid convoy loaded with food and medicine finally got through the besieged town of refugees. Many Professor Muffin Tin began adopting more little Mr Muffins.</p>
            Local officials in riot gear briefly blocked the march of men, women and children as they neared Shandong before dawn, to relay the offer of temporary ID papers, jobs for those seeking asylum in the province rather than killing themselves into the sea. Briskly, Professor Muffin Tin and other school teachers built small planes to help people flying away into destinations accepting refugees. Everyone was singing “goodbye, my old friend.” Mr Muffin felt it funny. “I’m already an ex-pats.” The corrupted official arrived in Zurich and just avoided the waves of battleships, gunfighting and bombs. A quicker emigrate policy was made too woo more wealthy Chinese into the country. The banks which catered to corrupted, super rich, born in wealth and powers, above a certain wealth threshold, were welcomed by Canadian government. “The sun set in moderate… everyone gets green grassland and sunshine,” the ads said. “We don’t want to cede the business to the U.S., every head we charge 6,000,000 to get a legal working permit and legal stay for 20 years,” a source said. In the single year, HSBC got $ 780 billion gold flowing into its accounts stashed from Chinese. While, any household was a David against Goliath, it had to survive the changes of political storms. </p>
            It’s hailstorms coming from sky. No girls without a car could survive. </p>
            Fun Gou was originally a kind of steamed dumplings. The skin was rive made. The fillings contain nuts, Chinese chives, champignons, pork. </p>
            For the skin: 10-12 skins, wheat starch 75g, tapioca starch 25g, 1-2 tsp veg oil. </p>
            1. Put the flour and 2 pincee de sel into a mixer. </p>
            2. 60ml boiling water, oil in. No more than 1tbp water if the pate looks dry. Put the pate aside for 20 min. </p>
            3. Cut a sausage from the pate. Cut into small balls with a cleaver with oil, then flatten them on the board. </p>
            For the filling: 4 ounces hachis de porc, 4 ounces fresh water chestnuts, 2 tbs bacon, 1 tbs light soy sauce, 1 tsp dark soy sauce, 1 tsp shaoxin, 3 tsp finely chopped onion, finely chopped ginger, 2 tsp huil d’sesame, 2 tsp sucre. </p>
            1. Battre legrement 1 egg white. Reunir the filling by hand. Seasoning with salt, black pepper powder. </p>
            2. Skins. 1 skin place a portion of the filling in the middle of the skin. Make dumplings. </p>
            3. Set a steamer. </p>
            4. Coucher l’appareil selon la taille des Fun Gou attendus sur papier sulfurise sec. </p>
            5. Cover the steamer. Turn heat down to lower for 20 min. </p>
            Professor Muffin Tin had a police related problem. In his life, he either experienced money issues, or political storms affecting his identity. </p>
            There were times when making money is not impossible and not allowed. There were times when sons should be punished just because his father was the opposite, rebellion or political enemies. Born to a father who split a country in two, and unfortunately not be able to be protected by the Pacific Americans, professor Muffin Tin hated this part. It became a burden. </p>
            People don’t go to laws to solve problems. Muffin Tin avoided police as much as possible. But every country he would like to flee to, or visit for personal reason, required a visa. Therefore, it would be a prolonged process dealing with police and officials from different parts of the planet after they set embassies again and personal application was allowed again. </p>
            It is like a longtime disease he would like to get rid of. It is a ticket to another chapter of life. The smell of police was so strong. The culture failed him, and every country he would like to go to would make him a minority. It’s not like life of pi leaving India and finally having a job and a house in Toronto or Tokyo. It’s paying one government and paying another one at the same time, and, hopefully anything won’t go wrong to fields that money could not cover. He could not get sick, he could not run out of money, policies should not change or he should catch up or change to plan B. Policies means politics and laws, imagine you got two ruling you. Police are law enforcement… so we say Professor Muffin Tin had a police related problem. </p>
            He is a strategist. He had a school covering all medical spending from tax payers’ money. He had schools and companies wanting him and his expertise. He made friends and fed them to make himself flexible. You never know it would rain or it would be a sunny day. He needed a very expensive id card and a new passport. It’s what made them an overseas Chinese: Chinese, but not a member of us. </p>
            I talked about “us”. I didn’t mean that it is forever. Maybe in Professor Muffin Tin’s mind, it had always been “you”. And in my a few foreign friends’ minds, I am “you”, or singular “you”. I think it should be plural. Stereotypes, Professor Muffin Tin wrote on his Grindr profile. You know how few are they in China and you know how strange we could be in their eyes in Europe. And, when you have been treated badly, do they think about “us”? </p>
            The laws are shinning overhead. It means it’s a gun. It means one sentence wrong and being published and read and sexually, anger aroused, there would a gun pointing on me. Professor Muffin Tin only had publications on journals. He didn’t really social and speak whatever he meant to. </p>
            Working abroad doesn’t pay Chinese government tax. His payment was by Euro. His wife needed to pay a lot: the bills. His wife had pension from China Post which she had served for a long time till retirement. </p>
            Professor Muffin Tin’s French was not good. Robbers were on streets and he went back home from lab very late. Somehow his sex behavior was known and someone ordered someone to rob him as well as rape him, in a dark corner where gay rights slogans were printed on the wall. Maybe he had offended someone unknown. He thought. He was short, strong, funny and cooked well. For dating purpose, he threw himself in the poll and ended up on different beds every morning. He wanted to know how a police, a guard worked, so he was curious and interested, went into a guard’s home, slept with him. Sometimes he left an email address, sometimes he got drunk, sometimes he starred the man and they did for the second time, sometimes he could not remember the details. It was fleeting, random, irresponsible, hugging strangers who claimed he do sodomies. And always no day light, ran into hugs in 9-11pm and woke up, left a stranger’s house to catch up with working hours in early morning where there was no person on street, chilly autumn mornings.</p>
            Professor noticed that he liked men more after he had held the marriage with a woman he didn’t know for five years. That was at the end of cultural revolution, he was preparing to go back to Shanghai. He slept with a worker with four kids. Older, just let the lust burn. He was told that, in the classic Chinese education, that he should report his thoughts to a party member as soon as possible after they happened. He didn’t report. He talked with a musician once, though. The musician said, brotherhood, great brotherhood. It became an underground behavior happening once in several years until late 2000s. </p>
            In his 60s, he began to date almost freely. He had no time left: he was very busy, both at work and making documents. His health was fine while he knew that he had muscular atrophy. He had to keep the three machines working: his body, his money, his connections. He could not let one drop of gay water destroy his lifelines. Very well, the Taiwanese came into his life. The guy was well disciplined, meaning he didn’t sleep around, not a threat to a family, a husband or a wife, or a friend. He appeared to be working for an engineering company and had a small amount of heritage. They moved to a small town where grapes were kept, shielded by a piece of Mr Muffin’s small estate empire’s wall of private owned land. </p>
