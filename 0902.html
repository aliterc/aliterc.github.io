		<h1>Billy Yin-six</h1>

			Mistakes befell Tartarus under construction: explosion in B deck ended with death roll of workers. This would be his debut in estate market in china. He was not a rookie embarking on a new career. The insurmountable problem was government put a deadline on this government project. To get coups, he ran the project 24 h a day, with three switches who were local farmers sleeping on site or drinking, spending without sleep before work: a camera just showed water pouring into decks in such an accident. The design was industry leading, the complexity of building was boxes of tricks: they emptied an egg then put a city in. Alarms rang, gates closing, workers escaping, one could see others running under their feet through the narrow steel made paths and stairs. Rousing speeches should be given by the director, so some avoided to eat in the onsite catering. As one of the workers complained afterwards.  </p>
            Wheat Flour (Wheat Flour, Calcium Carbonate, Iron, Niacin, Thiamin), Garlic and Parsley Topping (30%), Water, Yeast, Salt, Flour Treatment Agent (Ascorbic Acid).<p> 
			Cheapskate is a miserly person. He agitated the water to mixed the spices well. Debunking the high fame of Chinese cooking, he used egg, chicken leg, prawns as the three things needed. In a symposium during a fluids tech conference, everyone was asked to bring some food. His gloves were white with blue stitching, which were made by himself. In the rare known French movie, a pair of swans were feeding by upending. The resources left in the river were dwindling to a trickle so they had to speed up the process of catching and eating. He was renowned for his ways of getting bargains at groceries and butchers. He wanted to express his feeling towards him who just trampled down his fence. The young men liked harsh, draconian, severe rules he put on them in their relationships. They ripened beautifully. Building up the organic farm had not been easy, says Mr Slave, who worked in the school’s garden, biting into one of the juicy green and red-flecked fruits. Through the teeming thoroughfares of central Paris the food company drove short but stocky young scientist who were among the loyalists to the slavery farm in Kent.<p>
			On a piece of plank laid his mixed seafood noodle. It was an entrenched idea that poached eggs are a symbol of breakfast. Chicken leg meat, mushroom, shallots, seaweed, the smell, heat, had gone beyond human perceptions. Every cell of his whooped for a bowl of noodle with a great topping. Now with great fortitude enduring his illness, Professor Muffin Tin was happy to see a too much version of the mixed seafood noodle made by Monica in long red dress. <p>
			Instructions: 220°C / Fan 200°C / Gas 7 7-10 mins. Place on a baking tray on the top shelf of a preheated oven for 7-10 minutes or until golden brown.<p>
			Grill<p> 
			Instructions: Place under a preheated medium grill for 3-5 minutes, turn and grill for a further 1 minute.<p>

			Billy Yin never thought of owning a house, or being big. All he thought was clean his own ass, which means cover all the expense by himself and have a little savings. </p>
            He no longer used Weibo, where all bright young people microblogged. He felt old after years of working. He had to get married, raise children, be the angels. He caught up with a couple of Brazilian in covert garden’s empty Jamie Oliver’s restaurant once. The husband told him to visit south part of the country, not capital part. He boiled the water, making his instant noodles. What flavor? His favorite was… yes, without a colleague degree, he would have been wandering around like the receptionists, waiters, chefs, sellers… out of the expertise, people have no difference. Everybody has a cross to carry and their courses are different. He hardly knew if he could find the next sun. It was easy, the city of stars, open your eyes, stars are all there. Hopes are all there. While, winter blue, he found tears always in his eyes. </p>
            City of stars… he never thought about being famous… in the center of dessert, stars were very clear. His favorite flavor was the pork rib mixed seafood. Then he ordered McDonald’s 37 rmb beef burger which cost 100 to be delivered to the base’s military check point, scanned, checked, picked up at the door. </p>
            He had been used to frozen food and instant noodles. They were full of hopes. Though frozen food were not fresh and cheap, they means a lot. They means human invented fridges, freezers, spice blenders. He knew that Mr Muffin had green hills and small island in oceans. He himself had was the whole space with no oxygen. He could hold breath for five long minutes. He could not eat any fresh things for weeks. </p>
            Military food were, the 16 rmb stainless plate Billy Yin would never buy, with mushrooms, cookies, carrots and a cup of water, protein powder, fat, sugar, vegs, vatmine pills, blended in one like making a sauce in a food processor. Drink it. His coworker said. They are in French style. </p>
            Billy Yin got all he needed from the food. They decided to launch the rocket to Triton next week. He was taught how to wash clothes in the rocket, how to cook on the ship, and how to keep a good sleep. His sister skyped him one night, saying she was on the way back to Neptune and they would sell the houses their parents left them as she decided to marry the Swedish and make another passport for Billy Yin. That was a big news for Billy Yin. As a man, being given a benefit, was like he had been paralyzed for years. Accepted it, definitely yes. He counted his bank account, he had spent all on the trips to south Africa, Chile… if the government won’t pay quickly after they ended this moon project, he would borrow. And, better leave on the moon, Billy Yin hated the earth deeply. </p>
            Once again, he stuck in traffic. He brushed teeth, washed face, took the shower, changed on his best cloth of the day, took the car’s key, started the engine, threw files onto the seats, turned on the radio for Mr Muffin’s morning show. The car got jammed outside the loop, approaching the 1% unpopular rich guys’ territory. He began to shave. Sun got out from behind the buildings. Last night’s romance didn’t make him an angel, the girl left after sex in the car. He shouted at an unlucky guy who sent fliers through cars. He looked promising, handsome, in the river of young people in suits serving this company or that. </p>
            It won’t take years that he could create a family and travel to convent garden with his wife, telling other young man, travelling alone, which part of the country to visit. A war came and everything stopped. He began to hide in Shanghai and never send any explorers and messages again to the border of solar system. Travelling was no longer safe. This time, only this time, a military is involved, he dared to put himself in the desert to go to out space again. Just don’t. His dead parent told him to suffer and never revenge, nor even feel angry. That’s the best way for a young person to survive. </p>
            Je suis malade. In a warm summer evening. I’ve been speaking English since I was seven years old. We are going to talk through. Vou ce di si? Are you from here? Tu da fi. Absolutely. Nou son par du. We are lost. Love bird got lost. My wife has just said. Alloh, well. Guest wu sha shi? What are you looking for? Nou sha shong a restaurant called golden lion. </p>
            Mr Muffin called his friend A: hi, dentist… could you do teeth cleaning? Un fat, toot lis men… almost every week… ma fam to find again… je suis vu le monte she le… I’m going to show you it on the map… Chinese turned to believe in empty words… stories like Titanic, Great Gatsby made them exited. This year, I was writing about Mr Darcy, but I felt the writing process had always been disturbed. First is local brands’ reactions to home applications, medical, this and that. It’s like a prisoners’ fighting. By nature, Chinese are not good with medicines. So every effort made would be of no effects. </p>
            Mr Muffin called his friend B who went to gym often and was a body builder: … Should Mr Darcy be muscled, like man of men, Ben Affleck… is the spelling right? Women needs a person to carry things, a body guard… but men could not fulfill these needs… so women don’t need men any longer… and God’s punishment on men ends. Seductive as it could be, why should men be muscled, with so many money into the gym, just for a woman to eat him and live longer than him? </p>
            So a man is lonely. Mr Muffin called his friend C: in the whole universe I met you online… you are a house owner and I’m working in burgerking, checking my HIV yearly… could you be my companion for this journey of life? Mr Muffin was serious… and desperate… but the man was poor… he owned no land in the island and no private jet… Mr Muffin owned several islands to escape to and all food network’s ads… he knows that British loves money, not his ugly appearance and the distance between them…</p>
            He cried in a hot bath. Always tears in his eyes. His nerve system broke down. He felt nothing. He called his friend D who needed his warmth, hug and comforting. He left the next morning to his Apple like home in Hangzhou. His friend D moved and he lost his address, phone number in the coming busy days. Somewhere in another hot bathroom, his friend D cried too. </p>
            Mr Muffin felt pains. He called his friend E. His friend E’s father was a doctor specialized in that kind of pains. His friend E was nice looking, fat, lovely and big. Mr Muffin only loved two persons in the world, his long lost lover Zu and the Welsh man. This pain was from someone else. The man touched his backbone and was a business partner. He didn’t know his name but he noticed him in the crowd of dealers. They smelt each other. Then they had sex often but Mr Muffin refused to continue meeting as he could not sleep by the side of the man on bed. He was not religious but believed in these things. He went to churches. Then he lost a man who understood his pain and tiredness, the man who wanted to pay half of his Apple store like house’s bill. His heart broke into pieces and never recovered until the Welshman slipped in to heal him, and around when he was receiving curses from the darkness. My wife, when the light that used to guide me faded away, you came out. Thank you. Thank you. All the poems are not for you, they are for the man I have lost. He asked if god could bring the man back… god said no. </p>
            Thousands of Chinese were fleeing from war zone to Shandong. The caravan of thousands of refugees was making its way towards the Sea through Shandong province. Security guards made regular patrols at night but refugees were climbing over the fences. Death roll ramped up. The employment if refugees was mooted in a crowded border city’s city council. They decided to recruit the war victims into a farm monetizing from church properties. Special economic zone controlled by gangs was filled by people with cars rushing into the sea. The decline of oil supplies this year follows exponential growth of oil price in the past few years. More car owners committed suicides. When they jointed the evolution, the new government promised them with land distribution. While, in Sicily, the small special economic zone, the poorest didn’t get what they want. Still, the rich lived in city center with flashy mansions and cars. The poor starve and struggled in city fringes. This city reminded us every minute who we were and which parts we were living in. More people committed suicides and would like to do so, the figures were obtained by extrapolating from past trends, which spooked investors. Though Shandong was faring better than its peers, its regaining momentum of economy was unknown. Market volatility, goods blocked during transportation, all there were just small results of a big government falling down. </p>
            Something that should not be forgotten was lost. “…materilxpaths,” one of Mr Muffin’s employees spoke he spell to sculptures, hastening the releasing of a deeper war. Many reported the cars were autonomous. The truth was they were dispersed from M14 to M16, then into the sea. A United Nations aid convoy loaded with food and medicine finally got through the besieged town of refugees. Many Professor Muffin Tin began adopting more little Mr Muffins.</p>
            Local officials in riot gear briefly blocked the march of men, women and children as they neared Shandong before dawn, to relay the offer of temporary ID papers, jobs for those seeking asylum in the province rather than killing themselves into the sea. Briskly, Professor Muffin Tin and other school teachers built small planes to help people flying away into destinations accepting refugees. Everyone was singing “goodbye, my old friend.” Mr Muffin felt it funny. “I’m already an ex-pats.” The corrupted official arrived in Zurich and just avoided the waves of battleships, gunfighting and bombs. A quicker emigrate policy was made too woo more wealthy Chinese into the country. The banks which catered to corrupted, super rich, born in wealth and powers, above a certain wealth threshold, were welcomed by Canadian government. “The sun set in moderate… everyone gets green grassland and sunshine,” the ads said. “We don’t want to cede the business to the U.S., every head we charge 6,000,000 to get a legal working permit and legal stay for 20 years,” a source said. In the single year, HSBC got $ 780 billion gold flowing into its accounts stashed from Chinese. While, any household was a David against Goliath, it had to survive the changes of political storms. </p>
            It’s hailstorms coming from sky. No girls without a car could survive. </p>
            Fun Gou was originally a kind of steamed dumplings. The skin was rive made. The fillings contain nuts, Chinese chives, champignons, pork. </p>
            For the skin: 10-12 skins, wheat starch 75g, tapioca starch 25g, 1-2 tsp veg oil. </p>
            1. Put the flour and 2 pincee de sel into a mixer. </p>
            2. 60ml boiling water, oil in. No more than 1tbp water if the pate looks dry. Put the pate aside for 20 min. </p>
            3. Cut a sausage from the pate. Cut into small balls with a cleaver with oil, then flatten them on the board. </p>
            For the filling: 4 ounces hachis de porc, 4 ounces fresh water chestnuts, 2 tbs bacon, 1 tbs light soy sauce, 1 tsp dark soy sauce, 1 tsp shaoxin, 3 tsp finely chopped onion, finely chopped ginger, 2 tsp huil d’sesame, 2 tsp sucre. </p>
            1. Battre legrement 1 egg white. Reunir the filling by hand. Seasoning with salt, black pepper powder. </p>
            2. Skins. 1 skin place a portion of the filling in the middle of the skin. Make dumplings. </p>
            3. Set a steamer. </p>
            4. Coucher l’appareil selon la taille des Fun Gou attendus sur papier sulfurise sec. </p>
            5. Cover the steamer. Turn heat down to lower for 20 min. </p>
            Professor Muffin Tin had a police related problem. In his life, he either experienced money issues, or political storms affecting his identity. </p>
            There were times when making money is not impossible and not allowed. There were times when sons should be punished just because his father was the opposite, rebellion or political enemies. Born to a father who split a country in two, and unfortunately not be able to be protected by the Pacific Americans, professor Muffin Tin hated this part. It became a burden. </p>
            People don’t go to laws to solve problems. Muffin Tin avoided police as much as possible. But every country he would like to flee to, or visit for personal reason, required a visa. Therefore, it would be a prolonged process dealing with police and officials from different parts of the planet after they set embassies again and personal application was allowed again. </p>
            It is like a longtime disease he would like to get rid of. It is a ticket to another chapter of life. The smell of police was so strong. The culture failed him, and every country he would like to go to would make him a minority. It’s not like life of pi leaving India and finally having a job and a house in Toronto or Tokyo. It’s paying one government and paying another one at the same time, and, hopefully anything won’t go wrong to fields that money could not cover. He could not get sick, he could not run out of money, policies should not change or he should catch up or change to plan B. Policies means politics and laws, imagine you got two ruling you. Police are law enforcement… so we say Professor Muffin Tin had a police related problem. </p>
            He is a strategist. He had a school covering all medical spending from tax payers’ money. He had schools and companies wanting him and his expertise. He made friends and fed them to make himself flexible. You never know it would rain or it would be a sunny day. He needed a very expensive id card and a new passport. It’s what made them an overseas Chinese: Chinese, but not a member of us. </p>
            I talked about “us”. I didn’t mean that it is forever. Maybe in Professor Muffin Tin’s mind, it had always been “you”. And in my a few foreign friends’ minds, I am “you”, or singular “you”. I think it should be plural. Stereotypes, Professor Muffin Tin wrote on his Grindr profile. You know how few are they in China and you know how strange we could be in their eyes in Europe. And, when you have been treated badly, do they think about “us”? </p>
            The laws are shinning overhead. It means it’s a gun. It means one sentence wrong and being published and read and sexually, anger aroused, there would a gun pointing on me. Professor Muffin Tin only had publications on journals. He didn’t really social and speak whatever he meant to. </p>
            Working abroad doesn’t pay Chinese government tax. His payment was by Euro. His wife needed to pay a lot: the bills. His wife had pension from China Post which she had served for a long time till retirement. </p>
            Professor Muffin Tin’s French was not good. Robbers were on streets and he went back home from lab very late. Somehow his sex behavior was known and someone ordered someone to rob him as well as rape him, in a dark corner where gay rights slogans were printed on the wall. Maybe he had offended someone unknown. He thought. He was short, strong, funny and cooked well. For dating purpose, he threw himself in the poll and ended up on different beds every morning. He wanted to know how a police, a guard worked, so he was curious and interested, went into a guard’s home, slept with him. Sometimes he left an email address, sometimes he got drunk, sometimes he starred the man and they did for the second time, sometimes he could not remember the details. It was fleeting, random, irresponsible, hugging strangers who claimed he do sodomies. And always no day light, ran into hugs in 9-11pm and woke up, left a stranger’s house to catch up with working hours in early morning where there was no person on street, chilly autumn mornings.</p>
            Professor noticed that he liked men more after he had held the marriage with a woman he didn’t know for five years. That was at the end of cultural revolution, he was preparing to go back to Shanghai. He slept with a worker with four kids. Older, just let the lust burn. He was told that, in the classic Chinese education, that he should report his thoughts to a party member as soon as possible after they happened. He didn’t report. He talked with a musician once, though. The musician said, brotherhood, great brotherhood. It became an underground behavior happening once in several years until late 2000s. </p>
            In his 60s, he began to date almost freely. He had no time left: he was very busy, both at work and making documents. His health was fine while he knew that he had muscular atrophy. He had to keep the three machines working: his body, his money, his connections. He could not let one drop of gay water destroy his lifelines. Very well, the Taiwanese came into his life. The guy was well disciplined, meaning he didn’t sleep around, not a threat to a family, a husband or a wife, or a friend. He appeared to be working for an engineering company and had a small amount of heritage. They moved to a small town where grapes were kept, shielded by a piece of Mr Muffin’s small estate empire’s wall of private owned land. </p>
