I read The Guardian film reviews. I have applied for NYU Tisch school twice. I don't read entertainment news. I know a little about lightning and sculpting. Dr Richard Clayton from Cambridge Univeristy once gave me an [interview](https://allenneptune.wordpress.com/2018/05/03/appendices/). I had shortly stayed in print shops and then wanted to make my own weekly online channel SEV7ENPLUS. After that, I shot photos and shared them online COVELNEPTUNE with a moving workstation. I found that I hardly know any Americans though film making really needs Americans._

BERLIN (Reuters) - Madame Tussauds in Berlin unveiled its latest attraction on Tuesday - a posturing Donald Trump figure striking a picture of German Chancellor [Angela Merkel](https://www.pronouncenames.com/search?name=Angela+Merkel) on a punchball.

Unlike the usual wax figures, the new moving “Trump” in the Berlin museum is an actor wearing a [silicone](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/silicone?q=silicone) mask modeled on the billionaire U.S. president, dancing to the [Abba (Swedish pronunciation: [²abːa])](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY8GMV5ixcU) hit “Money, Money, Money”.

- 0919 China to penalize $60 billion of U.S. imports in tit-for-tat move

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - China and the United States plunged deeper into a trade war on Tuesday after Beijing added $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list in retaliation for President Donald Trump’s planned levies on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.

The tit-for-tat measures are the latest escalation in an increasingly protracted trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies.

- What is vaginitis?

Vaginitis, also called vulvovaginitis, is an inflammation or infection of the vagina. It can also affect the vulva, which is the external part of a woman's genitals. Vaginitis can cause itching, pain, discharge, and odor.

Vaginitis is common, especially in women in their reproductive years. It usually happens when there is a change in the balance of bacteria or yeast that are normally found in your vagina. There are different types of vaginitis, and they have different causes, symptoms, and treatments.

What are the different causes of vaginitis?
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in women ages 15-44. It happens when there is an imbalance between the "good" and "harmful" bacteria that are normally found in a woman's vagina. Many things can change the balance of bacteria, including

Taking antibiotics

Douching

Using an intrauterine device (IUD)

Having unprotected sex with a new partner

Having many sexual partners

Yeast infections (candidiasis) happen when too much candida grows in the vagina. Candida is the scientific name for yeast. It is a fungus that lives almost everywhere, including in your body. You may have too much growing in the vagina because of

Antibiotics

Pregnancy

Diabetes, especially if it is not well-controlled

Corticosteroid medicines

Trichomoniasis can also cause vaginitis. Trichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted disease. It is caused by a parasite.

You can also have vaginitis if you are allergic or sensitive to certain products that you use. Examples include vaginal sprays, douches, spermicides, soaps, detergents, or fabric softeners. They can cause burning, itching, and discharge.

Hormonal changes can also cause vaginal irritation. Examples are when you are pregnant or breastfeeding, or when you have gone through menopause.

Sometimes you can have more than one cause of vaginitis at the same time.

What are the symptoms of vaginitis?
The symptoms of vaginitis depend on which type you have.

With BV, you may not have symptoms. You could have a thin white or gray vaginal discharge. There may be an odor, such as a strong fish-like odor, especially after sex.

Yeast infections produce a thick, white discharge from the vagina that can look like cottage cheese. The discharge can be watery and often has no smell. Yeast infections usually cause the vagina and vulva to become itchy and red.

You may not have symptoms when you have trichomoniasis. If you do have them, they include itching, burning, and soreness of the vagina and vulva. You may have burning during urination. You could also have gray-green discharge, which may smell bad.

How is the cause of vaginitis diagnosed?
To find out the cause of your symptoms, your health care provider may

Ask you about your health history

Do a pelvic exam

Look for vaginal discharge, noting its color, qualities, and any odor

Study a sample of your vaginal fluid under a microscope

In some cases, you may need more tests.

What are the treatments for vaginitis?

The treatment depends on which type of vaginitis you have.

BV is treatable with antibiotics. You may get pills to swallow, or cream or gel that you put in your vagina. During treatment, you should use a condom during sex or not have sex at all.

Yeast infections are usually treated with a cream or with medicine that you put inside your vagina. You can buy over-the-counter treatments for yeast infections, but you need to be sure that you do have a yeast infection and not another type of vaginitis. See your health care provider if this is the first time you have had symptoms. Even if you have had yeast infections before, it is a good idea to call your health care provider before using an over-the-counter treatment.

The treatment for trichomoniasis is usually a single-dose antibiotic. Both you and your partner(s) should be treated, to prevent spreading the infection to others and to keep from getting it again.

If your vaginitis is due to an allergy or sensitivity to a product, you need to figure out which product is causing the problem. It could be a product that you started using recently. Once you figure it out, you should stop using the product.

If the cause of your vaginitis is a hormonal change, your health care provider may give you estrogen cream to help with your symptoms.

Can vaginitis cause other health problems?

It is important to treat BV and trichomoniasis, because having either of them can increase your risk for getting HIV or another sexually transmitted disease. If you are pregnant, BV or trichomoniasis can increase your risk for preterm labor and preterm birth.

How can I prevent vaginitis?

To help prevent vaginitis

Do not douche or use vaginal sprays

Use a condom when having sex

Avoid clothes that hold in heat and moisture

Wear cotton underwear

- 0916 Tariffs threaten market-leading tech, consumer stocks

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. technology and consumer discretionary stocks have been insulated from global trade tensions, but if another round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods goes into effect, even those high-flying sectors could come down to earth.

The United States and China have already imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of each other’s goods. The White House has proposed tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including furniture, handbags and some computer parts.

- 0913 How Myanmar forces burned, looted and killed in a remote village

On Sept. 2, Buddhist villagers and Myanmar troops killed 10 Rohingya men in Myanmar's restive Rakhine state. Reuters uncovered the massacre and has pieced together how it unfolded. During the reporting of this article, two Reuters journalists were arrested by Myanmar police.

INN DIN, Myanmar – Bound together, the 10 Rohingya Muslim captives watched their Buddhist neighbors dig a shallow grave. Soon afterwards, on the morning of Sept. 2, all 10 lay dead. At least two were hacked to death by Buddhist villagers. The rest were shot by Myanmar troops, two of the gravediggers said.

“One grave for 10 people,” said Soe Chay, 55, a retired soldier from Inn Din’s Rakhine Buddhist community who said he helped dig the pit and saw the killings. The soldiers shot each man two or three times, he said. “When they were being buried, some were still making noises. Others were already dead.”

- Expression examples

Many of the examples in this section are based on expressions provided by Dan Ebberts.

Online resources for expression examples

Dan Ebberts provides example expressions and tutorials for learning how to work with expressions on his MotionScript website. For example, Dan provides an excellent page about collision detection.

Colin Braley provides a tutorial and example project on his website that show how to use expressions to make one layer repel others in a natural-seeming manner.

The AE Enhancers forum provides many examples and much useful information about expressions, as well as scripts and animation presets. In this post on the AE Enhancers forum, Paul Tuersley provides a tutorial and example project that show how to use expressions to animate several layers in a swarm.

Rick Gerard provides an example on his website that demonstrates rolling a square object along a floor so that the sides stay in contact with the floor plane.

Carl Larsen provides a video tutorial on the Creative COW website that demonstrates how to use expressions and parenting to relate the rotation of a set of wheels to the horizontal movement of a vehicle.

Chris Zwar provides an example project on his website for automatically arranging still images or videos into a grid (like a video wall). You can easily adjust position and spacing with sliders that are connected to a system of expressions. There are three compositions in the project—one for stills, one for videos, and one to create an auto-storyboard in which a video is sampled at user-defined intervals and aligned into a grid.

JJ Gifford’s website provides several example projects that demonstrate how to use expressions.

Maltaannon (Jerzy Drozda, Jr.) provides a video tutorial on his website that shows how to use expressions to create a volume meter using the results of the Convert Audio To Keyframes command.

Harry Frank provides a tutorial on his graymachine website that shows how to use expressions to read data from an external text file.

- Rashes

Also called: Dermatitis, Skin rash

A rash is an area of irritated or swollen skin. Many rashes are itchy, red, painful, and irritated. Some rashes can also lead to blisters or patches of raw skin. Rashes are a symptom of many different medical problems. Other causes include irritating substances and allergies. Certain genes can make people more likely to get rashes.

Contact dermatitis is a common type of rash. It causes redness, itching, and sometimes small bumps. You get the rash where you have touched an irritant, such as a chemical, or something you are allergic to, like poison ivy.

Some rashes develop right away. Others form over several days. Although most rashes clear up fairly quickly, others are long-lasting and need long-term treatment.

Because rashes can be caused by many different things, it's important to figure out what kind you have before you treat it. If it is a bad rash, if it does not go away, or if you have other symptoms, you should see your health care provider. Treatments may include moisturizers, lotions, baths, cortisone creams that relieve swelling, and antihistamines, which relieve itching.

- 0912 U.S. southeast braces for 'days and days' of floods from hurricane

HOLDEN BEACH, N.C. (Reuters) - The powerful Hurricane Florence threatened to bring “days and days” of rain and potentially deadly flooding to the U.S. southeast coast, North Carolina’s governor warned on Tuesday, as some 1 million people were ordered to evacuate their homes.

The storm threatened to hit coastal North and South Carolina with 130 mile-per-hour (215 kph) winds and massive waves when it makes landfall on Friday, and its rains will take a heavy toll for miles inland, the National Hurricane Center in Miami warned.

- How much is China’s $60-billion really worth?

Forty-eight African heads of state gathered in Beijing on September 3 and 4 for the seventh Forum for China-Africa Co-operation (Focac), a three-yearly display of China and Africa’s “friendship”, “win-win co-operation”and one-directional fund-funnelling.

The last Focac in 2015, held in Johannesburg, saw China pledge $60-billion to Africa in the form of loans, export credits and grants.

Focac is ostensibly about improving economic ties and helping Africa fulfil its development potential. This year, Chinese President Xi Jinping spared no sentimentality in his references to China’s “brother” —Africa.

- Viewpoint: Ortega's Nicaragua crisis evokes memories of past

"How did we not realise that they were becoming monsters? How did we let them get away with so much?" an old woman asked me, crying, at an anti-government demonstration in the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, at the end of April.

The upset woman was a former member of the Sandinista rebel group, which successfully rose up against President Anastasio Somoza in 1979, thereby putting an end to more than 40 years of bloody rule by his family.

Now, four decades on from the overthrow of Somoza, she was taking to the streets against the government of Daniel Ortega, himself a former rebel and Sandinista leader.

- Doug Ford hints at shrinking Ottawa city council

As he digs in for a fight to slash the size of Toronto's city council, Ontario Premier Doug Ford is now hinting he's eyeing other councils in Ontario, including Ottawa's.

In an interview with Global News Radio 640 Toronto, when asked whether he'd consider shrinking other city councils in Ontario, Ford said he's focusing on Toronto but hinted Ottawa could be on his radar.

- COPD

COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) makes it hard for you to breathe. The two main types are chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The main cause of COPD is long-term exposure to substances that irritate and damage the lungs. This is usually cigarette smoke. Air pollution, chemical fumes, or dust can also cause it.

At first, COPD may cause no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, symptoms usually become more severe. They include

A cough that produces a lot of mucus

Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity

Wheezing

Chest tightness

Doctors use lung function tests, imaging tests, and blood tests to diagnose COPD. There is no cure. Treatments may relieve symptoms. They include medicines, oxygen therapy, surgery, or a lung transplant. Quitting smoking is the most important step you can take to treat COPD.

- Scripts

2 Scripts included with After Effects

After Effects provides several prewritten scripts to assist you in performing common tasks, and to provide a basis for you to modify and create your own scripts.

Note: Run the sample script Demo Palette.jsx to get an idea of what sorts of things you can do with scripts.

3 Write and modify scripts

You can write your own scripts for use in After Effects by using the script editor, which is part of the ExtendScript Toolkit. The ExtendScript Toolkit provides a convenient interface for creating, debugging, and testing your own scripts. Sometimes, all that you need to do is make a slight modification to an existing script to make it do what you want; such slight modifications can often be performed with little knowledge of computer programming and scripting languages.

- Scripts

A script is a series of commands that tells an application to perform a series of operations. You can use scripts in most Adobe applications to automate repetitive tasks, perform complex calculations, and even use some functionality not directly exposed through the graphical user interface. For example, you can direct After Effects to reorder the layers in a composition, find and replace source text in text layers, or send an email message when rendering is complete.

- Genital Warts

Genital warts /wɔːrt/ are a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by the human papillomavirus /ˌpæpəˈloʊmə/ (HPV). The warts usually appear as a small bump or group of bumps in the genital area. They are flesh-colored and can be flat or look bumpy like cauliflower. Some genital warts are so small you cannot see them. In women, the warts usually occur in or around the vagina, on the cervix, or around the anus. In men, genital warts are less common. They may have warts on the tip of the penis, around the anus, or on the scrotum, thigh, or groin. She still loves him, warts and all.

You can get genital warts during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with an infected partner. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading HPV. The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have anal, vaginal, or oral sex. HPV vaccines may help prevent some of the HPV infections that cause genital warts.

Your health care provider usually diagnoses genital warts by seeing them. The warts might disappear on their own. If not, your health care provider can treat or remove them. HPV stays in your body even after treatment, so warts can come back.

- 0906 Commentary: Why Trump’s ‘Arab NATO’ plan won’t curb Iran

The first round of what U.S. President Donald Trump called “the most biting sanctions ever imposed” against Tehran went into effect on August 7. “Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States,” Trump continued, in a tweet posted that morning. An even more damaging second round of U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic, reinstated after Washington pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, is expected to take effect in November.  

Yet economic pressure is not the only tool the United States and its allies are using to counter Iran. In recent months, the Trump administration has been quietly working to forge a new security alliance, with the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and Oman – as well as Egypt and Jordan, to counter what it views as aggressive Iranian expansion in the region. Tentatively known as the Middle East Strategic Alliance (MESA) – but already nicknamed “Arab NATO” by the international press ­– U.S. and Arab officials say the coalition is being planned in an effort to expand cooperation on counterterrorism, missile defense and military training, partly to address the security challenges posed by Iran and its proxies.

### 怎样画TIN TIN
Posted by allenneptune on 01/05/2018

我很小的时候，其实想做个画家。

后来我越来越远了。现在基本不愿意画画。

但是我的确很感兴趣丁丁历险记是怎么画的。作者是个很严肃的catholic，连上班都是在catholic的报纸。刚开始是写东西，后来就开始画漫画在报纸上连载。我发现想出书很多人都在出版行业工作，也许我应该试试。我觉得旅行是件很危险的事 （the bbc’s xxx was shot dead)，尤其是想旅行到世界的每个角落，一定是充满“历险“的。

我前几天发现一件事，丁丁应该是个考古学家，而不是记者。记者只是记录，不去想解决问题，更不会去和谁作对。

据我对漫画作者的研究，画这个漫画的工艺还是蛮复杂的。首先起线稿，线稿是很草的，不像林莹老师的线稿那么纤细，没有多余的线，这个比利时人不是专业的画画科班出身的，是自学成才的，草稿改得基本看不成。然后据我看过一个俄国插画家画画的过程，要用红蓝铅笔改，再在更大的纸上再画一遍，纸再撑在一个木框上，便于水彩上色，最后用彩铅修饰。我不太明白用什么样的纸清理草稿，因为那时没有Photoshop没法调透明度蒙着勾线。先出版的是黑白的钢笔稿，有贴图。出版之后几年再出的彩色版。我还是不明白没有Photoshop怎么把颜色加在原来的黑白线稿下面，而且可以上色上得如此均匀。

中国画的工笔画其实上色也很均匀，我不是很明白宣纸上或者丝绢上怎么颜色不会晕开。

说丁丁历险记的画家开创了一种叫“清晰的线“的绘画风格，即人物没有阴影，颜色鲜明等。

据我推测，作者的背景画得极其像照片，尽管是寥寥几笔，不像日本风格的漫画中背景那么细致地画照片，也不想美国风格中那样细致地画背景，但从背景到人物都符合现实世界中的比例，看的时候感觉作者是的确去过这些地方的。尤其是很多跨文化的地方，作者完全是在找着照片描嘛。

拿南美洲为例，丁丁系列有两个故事都是在南美发生。我看到一个秘鲁的纪录片，有一个历史遗迹就是丁丁那一本旧版的封面。林莹老师在画魔尘的时候，去西藏旅行了，我对西藏的印象完全是被林老师消化过又创作出来的，我记忆很深林老师很精细的人物服装，佛庙装饰和风雪天。

宫崎骏的工作室经常去欧洲写生。

以上只讨论一个漫画系列的地点环境服装设定，关于人物的绘画，日本漫画有自己的方法，美国漫画全是费墨的肌肉男和阴影，丁丁系列就是很省墨，人物动作完全不走形很准确。作者的分镜头不像美日漫画那样乱搞—怎么会有那么奇形怪状的摄像机取景框—基本是一张纸从上到下四个column，没有斜的分镜，都是长方形正方形的，如果占用一个分镜占用一个column以上，一定是整个两个column，绝对不会出现竖着的分割（我有点语言表达不了了）。

2d动画也是画的。在B站上看到一个樱桃小丸子的工作室参观，讲如果是电影的话，剧本就要写七八个月。动画一秒七帧，原来是用透明的塑料板上画的，背景和动画都是手绘，叠在一起用一个向下的相机照。现在背景我们能看到还是手绘的，动画都用电脑画了。李安导演的中场休息说一秒120帧，很适合慢速嘛。再看迪士尼的手绘长篇，真有耐心啊。

我觉得画画是件很旧世界的事情，我自己是个依赖新科技的人，画画这种古老的艺术形式比起摄影来讲不很适合我，即使在电脑上画。我有点怀疑视效是不是适合我了，因为在视效的背后是很传统的艺术训练，是很古老的事情。

我在做照相，录像和写文章，做网站的成套出国旅行指南。恺撒旅游好像有把自己的卡通形象称为恺恺撒撒，就像静静安安，火车上的健健康康一样。我想做个 跟燕姿和仓木麻衣 游世界，因为新加坡和日本的护照旅行太好用了。

我去过的地方很少。小时候跟着父母旅行团，上中学基本不出西安市。大学时候跟着学生社团考试找工作去了一些地方。

我集中旅行实在12-13年，每周末我都要出去逛一下。

签证，由于我们国家的护照很不好用，艾未未还是陈丹青老师很早就放弃大陆护照了，应该是后者吧，办好了台湾护照后还去问使馆这个大陆护照能不能退还了。但是网络著名旅人在换加拿大护照之前还是用中国护照环游了世界，说明不要怪政府，要怪怪自己不用心，抱怨的人脸都不好看。

我去年把自己护照扔了，上面盖了两个国家的签证页。旅行的时候都要用护照开房，落地签时上飞机去的时候就很慌，边检似乎很明白签证政策还是懒，没记得盘问我，下飞机去落地签，感觉有点小贵，坐了巴士进城找不到宾馆，远的地方自己不会开车，没敢乱跑，第二天就坐飞机回了，其实订票的时候好像就订的是隔天的返程票，只在异国待了一天，主要是一个人也没计划好，一群人就敢多待几天的。

我觉得会开车会游泳是很关键的环球旅行本领。到一个地方乘公交来来回回很傻逼，不如到了就租个车，当然公交还是要熟悉因为搞不好就要乘公交的。游泳当然是为了自救。

文化冲突会很严重吧，没事就不要去不是旅游区的地方了。

中国少了一味药 是一部描绘社会问题的书。

抛弃作者要探讨的主题，其中的描写了四件社会问题：

无家可归
穿黑巷，众入黑屋。大房，里面几个卧室。大房沙发，郝金肖庞坐上吱吱作响，无明炷，味劣，鼾声四起。 

2. 家庭问题

3. 犯罪

打人就是招新人做你的赚钱机器，让你收回成本，坐收从他销量和招人中的你的那一份。分三步：市场列表，引人，迎接。 

4. 疾病

传说中前美国驻华大使就是因为这样的压力才辞职的。因为很像中国的外籍国内问题大臣。

我以前是摄影爱好者。一遇到社会问题有相机的都喜欢用黑白表现，什么绿车皮的人挤人站票难熬的三天三夜啊，什么拆迁啊，什么乞讨啊，总之触目惊心。如果是专业的摄影记者，机器好一点，报纸上印黑白也比较吓人，所以彩色照片看着但是内容一个比一个更吓人。

看过 贫民窟的百万富翁，感觉其实也都正常，没什么大不了的。

我最近觉得好像对这本小说的改编有点思路了。

From book to film
23
by :
ReganS

Like many people, I get an initial feeling of dread when I hear that a book I like has been turned into a film. Sometimes I won’t even watch the film even though I love the story! This is a sentiment shared by many and for good reasons too. Here are, what I believe to be, the main problems with films adapted from books.

Firstly, the characters are NEVER as you imagined them. Even if a novel provides a clear physical description and detailed analysis of all of their quirks and characteristics, the character is always different. It can also be difficult when a well-known celebrity is playing the role as it is hard to separate the real-person and the character.

Secondly, if a novel is long or filled with lots of action and events it is generally impossible to condense it down into a two hour long film without cutting parts out. Of course, nowadays it has become common to split a novel into two parts, making two films. However, if there is an event in the novel that does not necessarily progress the narrative and is not something that will appeal to the majority of the audience, then it is likely to be cut from the story completely.

Thirdly, filmmakers like to use a bit of artistic license, and can sometimes change a storyline completely. This can be to suit the audience the film is being aimed at or just because they feel their interpretation is more appropriate.

Finally, a film is just one interpretation of a novel. If a novel has been read by a million people then that means there are a million versions of that novel floating around in people’s minds. Therefore it is extremely improbable that the filmmaker has the same interpretation as you, or the other 999,999 readers.

It can be annoying watching a film that completely changes a story you like. The recent, award-winning film, Silver Linings Playbook, for example, was based on a book I love. It was changed an awful lot from the book, with various characters and events completely altered. However, despite being incredibly different, it maintained the same positive, feel-good mood of the book, making it really enjoyable. Do not be deterred from watching an adaptation, just because it might be different does not mean that you will definitely not enjoy it.

贾柯樟的电影描述社会问题。玉观音也在写社会问题。能解决社会问题的非官即神。

我们只是关心一下。

成人世界和儿童世界不同，是因为成人世界鲜血淋漓的。以前一直在拍城市，城市的city line， 城市的glory，城市精致的商店，花朵，夜里醉酒胡闹的人群。

最早有一个三星的手机，不能拍照没有存储卡。很薄。后来在买电脑的公交车上丢了。是我爸给我买的。

之后买了一个诺基亚的导航手机，据说相机是蔡司的头，导航地图很强大，很windows phone一样，概念很棒。现在那个app的概念也是那个手机就有的。手机的下落不明。

之后接触了摄影，第一个是在京东上吧，分期的佳能入门级相机，不是东京进口的。画面很漂亮，比尼康的柔。拍摄了汤机场，青海支教，慕田峪长城。大二买的，大三卖掉了。感觉这些电子设备一入手就二手价了。当时修图修得很重，其实原图就很漂亮了。

后来一阵没有相机，就在豆瓣上淘了一个二手的胶片机。做地铁到北京城里什么地方，对方以为我是个年龄很大的玩家。价钱是900块。这个相机拍了毕业季的情况，还有宁波的拆迁，基督教堂，还有生活小景，很适合带在口袋里有感觉了捏一张。冲洗的时候已经三卷了，宁波有冲洗的地方，卡迪夫也有，洗出来如果对焦准确还是很漂亮的。绿色调日本风。

大四元旦买了一个尼康的相机，一万块。但是这个机器后来用于拍摄视频很多。出门拍街上的人用它，出门游玩用它，拍摄美食用它，明显感觉有点大。但是当时身边有很多专业级大相机。

研一买了苹果的机器，平板，macbook和手机都有，就不怎么用第二个诺基亚手机，我爸买给我的，当时还蛮喜欢的因为龙云在用。摄影工作室的孩子挺富的，我原来穿的都是杂牌经常去动物园西单，现在不得不买苹果的itouch和牌子货。

研一的还买了一个当时Thomas Lethaud和老刘忙都在用的松下微单，很好用很舒服很像个女朋友。在人面前捏一张声音基本听不到，又不会抖，颜色对焦都很准。问题一点是视频格式有点诡异。这个相机一般是上街乱捏用的。我那时挺有钱乱跑的，但是很多地方到了都不拍照。有点自私不发照片。图虫也删光了。后来又入了三脚架，相机包，快门线，小dv。我采访的时候也用这个拍，有点不对，应该带三脚架打灯的。但是这样可能拍着人们没有压力。

我在证件照婚礼记录店打过工，会拍证件照，可是到了英国进了证件照店人家说要培训我很久不愿用我。

后来有一阵没有智能手机用，买不起，回国买了中关村买了一个5000块的港行水货三星，晨星同款，伦敦奥运会那阵很火的带手写笔的。后来又买了一个三星的手机，后来又买了一个三星的手机，都挺烂的。

我以前用新传的机器拍得手抖，又不会拍视频，还天天剪。到现在还是不会拍。

拍摄社会问题的时候会遇到阻拦，不论是官方的，还是被拍摄方。我问过媒体法的老师街上能不能乱拍，老师讲街上的都可以拍。实际上如果是自己拍的话，比较困难，如果是卧底暗访的话，自己做更困难了。

慕容雪村先生在我留学的时候还去英国了一次。他是比较有背景的，所以可以这样卧底。

我感觉他是有一对摄影记者的眼睛的。是那种很严肃的新闻摄影记者，不是官媒拍开会飘红旗一片花海粉红色气球的。

当然他非官非神，所以他只好记录下了。当你凝视深渊时，深渊会拉你下去。

The lost happiness (China) 200 RMB day return 5h Taipei_Gaoxiong

Life is a swirl. Once we admit this, half of the miseries in it have been explained. Life is a swirl, which means if you don’t work harder, you will be dragged down to the heart of the ocean automatically.

I heard this saying in the movie Duets (2000), which had bad reviews. So, these movies mislead audience.

Happiness is saving money. When you got a bargain and get the cheapest of the same quality, you must feel happy.

Maybe it is because I got into that I have been always unhappy. I’m sick and I can’t feel very happy. I force myself into a smile and it is hard.

Happiness is you end the long years of saving money and finally buy a house in full payment. You feel fine. You feel secure.

Happiness is the nightclub with a karaoke and loud music every night finally go away from your neighborhood.

Happiness is when we don’t need to care about anything, no string attached. When we got nothing to concern, we are free. Some may say this is irresponsible. That’s because irresponsible fathers in the UK abandoned their children and wives. They have to care for them. For me, I got nothing, even don’t have shelter for the night. I don’t have to care for anyone. I’m free. I’m happy.

If a Welsh could regain their ancestors’ land, they would be happy.

If a gay man could sleep with whoever he wants, he would be happy.

If a film maker could earn a single award in major festivals, he should be happy.

But sometimes we see people crying on train back to Wales, gay man in Russia got beaten on street, director with limited means showed his pocessions to the public.

I call it the pitch, the highest and lowest in a tone. If we only pick the best moments in our life, the dish must be very expensive. So during normal days, we store the best for festivals and guests, just eat plain white bread.

Karl Max said London’s white bread were full of steel’s taste. I have experienced that. While, in China, in Familymart, white bread slices were full of sweet milk flavour. And the flavour was a little too much.

We have all kinds of unhappiness. But for sure, when sales goes up, moneys come in, efforts get paid, needs are fulfilled, no war, no disease, no pollution, no crime, everyone got happier except those who are not nice guys.

We truly have enemies.

Wales got lots of medical tourists using fake EU cards to exploit the benefits, I heard it on news. Sucking dicks, sodomy, all ways of gay sex are dangerous. Have your mum ever told you not to eat human waste? Movies, by their size of images, are not cheap. It’s absolutely a matter of money.

When we got hurt, is there a way to be healed? Yes, beat them. They dragged us down to the lowest, we must get rid of them to go back to normal.

Write a song of your life, you will find that in order to make it popular, it should remain simple and not that much up and down. Only when you want to go academic you challenge the highest and lowest, which gives you time to be alone and cut in influence. These are places where we could lose or win the battles in the war with our enemies.

Triumphs are short moments. We may feel born loser, if we always stare at those peaks.

Four o’clock in the morning. A baozi shop like Greggs in the UK, began its working day. I applied for Greggs once and I liked the sausage rolls. The owner might be sleeping on the second floor of the shop at a corner of a road cross. After having layered ten bamboo made 60cm qb containers with raw, flour and yeast made baozi, she opened the switcher of the boiler under the containers. A bored looking man walked closer to ask if the baozi were ready to eat. About 25 more containers of flour made food were waiting there to be steamed and sold. Small business like this are filling empty shops under commercial and home use buildings. They, the buildings are like a wardrobe for clean cloths. If I were a giant, I needed something, I might open these drawers, and surprisingly found small people were living in them. But finding something in so many drawers won’t be easy.

This crowded, filled with people situation made you feel small. The baozi shop had a mixer; so they don’t knead doughs by hand. The fillings might be in a fridge. A worker was putting fillings into baozi skins every 30 seconds.

It was five o’clock in the morning. Cities’ day starts at four o’clock. Sky became brighter, from dark grey to light dark blue. It was quite comfortable, cool, talking with people, doing business, down there in the baozi shop, compared with staying in an over-used, dirty, hot, bad air, toilet like cheap hostel room all day long. But, being in hotel rooms is nearer to the homes upstairs.
Soft, hot, full of air, skin not too thick not too thin, white baozi were ready to eat.

The city was smelly, hot. People love it. They couldn’t find the right employees, the right girls or boys; so they put ad out of their windows to find the right small fish in the ocean.

Giant like me found it hard to look for anything in these wardrobes.

Six o’clock in the morning. Already buses had been filled with people. Cars still not started. No dogs, no camera, no smoking, no…were signed outside McDonald’s. H&M was shinning last night. Starbucks not opened yet. Pizza hut not opened yet. Kentucky Fried Chicken prepared 17 porridges and 24 soybean milks for its early opening. Hubs of shopping food and cloths, transport could be expensive. A young man behaved like in the ad, pushed the restaurant’s door. Waves of new dishes came out. Cars for sale at the airport waiting hall. Walmart had about 200 employees per shop while the fried chicken shop had about 20. They provided low skill, minimum wage jobs to the right people. Tiny shops could turn to extremely huge in China: everyone said there were gold here. Walmart’s chicken had been deep-fried, buns had been steamed and even, cooled. Well- facilitated kitchens in Walmart had everything that could be turned to food. And they were clean, extremely.

Vegetables had been washed and sent to cities, with other goods arriving too.

Cities were heavy, metal made, harmful, expensive and friendly in a way.

“I hate summer,” when it was 6:30, kids went to school, one of them said. I used to kind of like it. Considering all the sweat I have shed in summer for baking, bottled water and Zbrush, I hate it, too. Kid, I agree with you.

Finally, I realized there was a wine shop. It sold plum wine once The times was using as a gift. I lusted for its manager who looked like steward in Crouching and hidden. Time, give it time. It solved every shit things of my readership.

That was the exit.

Seven o’clock in the morning,  I boarded on a train from Bristol to London. It was 80 GBP. I thought I might need another week or two in London. The trains ran for two hours. Then I switched to the tube. In the morning, young miserable look thin man was cleaning windows of coffee shop in the winter. The landlord escorted me to the ATM machine. Then I quitted the idea of renting their house.

Eight o’clock, young chefs had their lazy breakfast, young students in school had their late breakfast, then rushed to classrooms for the fucking sleepy math class.

Nine o’clock in the morning, a job interview began. Ok, I left home at six.

Ten o’clock in the morning, morning shows stop. Restaurants began to prepare for the lunch. It could be very busy. Chinese chefs need to pre cook everything needed so they could shorten the time for every dish. Guys who had been on night switch should be feeling sleepy now.

Eleven o’clock. High school’s third class in the morning nearly ended. While, in university in China, it means lunch time started.

Twelve o’clock. Staff on trains began to sell over-priced food. They would say “which customer needs food? which customer needs food?” as if it was not lunch time.

One o’clock in the afternoon. It could be very hot on streets. Sweating.  Drops of water from air conditioners. Hot. Hot. You won’t think to buy a hot baozi now.

Two o’clock in the afternoon. Sara began her long sleepy lectures. Hidden behind monitors, sitting at a corner of a newsroom, I had to record everything she said.

Three o’clock in the afternoon. It could be not that hot. Everyone was thinking, hey, two hours to go.

Four o’clock in the afternoon. After a day of boring standing there, our wine shop finally began to have customers. Ten to nine.  Lots of people rushed to banks before their closure.

Five o’clock in the afternoon. Traffic.

Six o’clock in the afternoon. Teachers asked students’ parents to come to school to have a chat on some problems. Some students were still sweeping the classrooms. Night was approaching.

Seven o’clock in the afternoon. Classic China Central TV News.

Eight o’clock in the evening. TV drama. Kids crying. Washing machine.

Nine o’clock in the evening. People in service began to hate customers.

Ten o’clock in the evening. Night clubs began. Drinks, shouting.

Eleven o’clock in the evening. At the end of the day. Counting. Counting the money in your purse.

Twelve o’clock in the evening. Always began to forget to look at the watch… already passed midnight.

One. You could breathe.

Two. You could be unconscious and careless in the dream.

Three. You could fall, cry, laugh, mock, wash away all the masks. And another day of laboring and pushed, dragged, mentored… came.
And, some guys never slept during nights.

The good

This is a lesbian story.

When we went to grade seven, books began to have fewer pictures and they were in black and white. This story is meant to give grade seven to grade nine students a lesson to tell them what lesbian is.

Susan Perkin is a lesbian. She lives with her girlfriend who is a nurse in a health check center. Susan Perkin is owner of a coffee shop and a photo studio.

https://allenneptune.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/2014peanutsmovie_press_191114.jpg?w=300&h=200

One day she found herself got cancer. She had to shave herself bold to get the treatment. Her girlfriend is boyish and has many boys like her. She is straight, rude, short, black skin and beautiful. Her hair just reaches her shoulder.

Susan Perkin is also short. Her hair was cut short. She was awarded with several photo contest prize. A can of Coke is twenty in her coffee shop, which means the carefully arranged decoration (a bike on the wall), the clean and no smell toilets, the space, the facilities are stylish.

A couple of gay men wanted to open a bar nearby in this district near the Big tower where Chinese used to store books from India back to 700 AD. While, as my friend Joe moved into this district, I don’t think home owners would like to pay a visit to beer drinking and gay men dancing.

I was in a wine store for a day. Rich guys with oil money opened the shop for tea and wine. They played majiang and smoked all day long. Lots of meat with bones could be found in staff meal. They even had a chef and a very big stove. Only three staff shared a big bowl of meat— and one of them was a female saying she was intending to not eat, the other two were hungry college graduates.

I like rich guys. They make life brighter with their fancy four by fours and Gucci purses.

Summer is not hot to death. It was sunshine everywhere. Girls made their lips so red. When you look it twice, everything is a lie. Hidden behind food and clothing is called not suitable to be viewed. Shops close down quickly. Girls are ugly.

Just finished her travel to Japan, Susan Perkin received a resignation letter. Big Mac was shining in cold cold air conditioning but clients were not that many as it supposed to be to meet the rent.

I know you guys may rub yourselves at this early age. You may find sexual intercourse attractive and exciting. Men donate sperm into women’s worm then they got you guys. Sometimes, they do this not for making children purpose. So, that’s why same sex guys could have sex.

Doctors in the health check center see penises and genitals every day. They give them a quick look, then make a stamp on the paper to show pass or not.

Susan Perkin and her girlfriend were living in a neighborhood where gay men were singing together. They were in the club. Pretending to be someone’s wife is not a secret. When one man needs to get married to pass the thirty years old age when everyone elder wants you to be married, a lesbian could be found.

People in service are fucking hot in this district. People with best looking just pour in. Susan has married to a gay doctor, and her girlfriend has married to a gay seller. Things became complicated. By law, they could share properties and when divorce come, they should separate properties unless the marriage certificates are fake too.

Susan Perkin was dying. Cancer is curable but she died quickly. Then the shop was left to her girlfriend who had been relaxed, used to chatting all day long in the shit job. She quitted her job in the health center, focused on the café and photo business which she barely knew of.

The gay seller was an alcoholic addicted and bio sexual, once raped the slim girl. He was strong and big. She sang a lot. A lesbian from Singapore wanted to sleep with her and take her to Singapore. She refused.

Every night at twelve, Susan Perkin would appear. People say if the dead had something they miss very much, or things they could not forget, they would show up in the old house. Susan Perkin wanted to punish a girl who told her parents that she was a lesbian, which led directly to her separation with her parents.

That girl was the one in my one day wine shop experience, who said she didn’t want to eat.

Just 200 meters, the wine shop and the coffee shop had two guys who never see eye to eye.

Susan Perkin’s girlfriend attacked the wine shop girl one night. They were fighting each other using their teeth and nails. The gay doctor was returning home. Seeing this scene, he stopped them. Then they made a deal, transformed the coffee shop into a bar, the two professional sellers shoot off every day to get customers for the studio. They lived happy after forever.

Lesbian is les bian, which means the good.

### EAT, DRINK, MAN, WOMAN 1994 REVIEW

Eat, drink, man, woman 1994 Review

I am not really a big fan of pop singers. For writing’s purpose and to grab the end of my youth, I chose to claim I had been a fan of three silly girls. As age grows, I felt old and father like, esp. towards young women. And I might be the fan of the young girls, spoiling them and with no sensible thoughts just because they are the youngest.

It’s about friendship and three layers of voices. Though woman always don’t have true female friends after marriage, women are always helping themselves in their own ways of socializing and empowering. I don’t think I could manage woman’s stories as these male Chinese directors did in the 90s. Why could they see the world through women’s eyes.

But at least I could be a fan. Silly, shallow, simple, S.H.E., the Taiwanese pop band of three female singers, had one album after another. Quickly they had lots of fans and became as popular as other best selling Taiwanese singers in Chinese world.

Ang Lee’s films had been uneasy to understand for me. This movie is esp. lovely by people as its topic is shallow, simple and silly. The widowed man was a Chinese cuisine master and had been thinking, oh, just have sex again until my girls have married themselves. He must have been very sick and unsatisfied with his sex life. This movie is all about his hunger. The same thing happened to the elder daughter who had been dreaming in a poor country through Taiwan’s economy was booming. The smartest one of the three was a business woman in sales, who finally got nothing actually. Seen as a Herr of her father’s tricky skills and whole Chinese classic culture, she was beautiful. The youngest married herself earliest, just as Jane Austen had written. Could we say the whole family were silly as none of them was in the right path regarding to marriage and sex life.

Well, as a movie lover, I had the feeling that the director had been used to things needing lots of steps to make, which is advanced level or difficult in recipes. The band has faded out from our adult life and I have missed the years of being a crazy teenager fan. One night, I was in a KFC and a teenager girl was just sitting there after attending a concert. They, I mean the teenagers, were easy going and she had a little chat with me about her idol. Healthy, sunshine, harmless, these idols should be very careful with their public figures.

### 寻枪 一
Posted by allenneptune on 29/04/2018

（11970 字）

单位的小刘丢了一把枪。

土耳其。

深夜。重案六组的季洁和几个中年男子带着小李在光秃秃的山上转悠。黑糊糊的画面上只有三辆车的大灯顺着公路。海浪拍着光秃秃的山。季洁开始抱怨她儿子在美国上学的跟不上。季洁讲：你说那个汤唯吧，拍了个大色情片成名了。我和她配戏就出了那么几场。哎呀呀。咱们这些规矩的人怎么活。重案六组里那个秃头讲：说了我们不是搞艺术的，人家那才是，艺术。

车停了，大灯开着。季洁把小李扭下车，转了几个圈。两个人消失在了海边的草里。

海风呼呼地。一辆火车从远景的上方驶过。这是个很荒凉的地方，属于火车上看哪种没有几户人家的山区。火车上的人往这边看就看见几个车灯，像极了山西陕西交接的那些夜里没有几处灯的地方。火车上的人纳闷，这么晚在荒野做什么。这边的警察讲，老子执行公务，祝你娘火车开海里，生娃没屁眼，乱管闲事。

小刘的老朋友小李多年没有联系了。小李喜欢的女孩在加拿大，小李执意要跟过去。就像电影金玉满堂中的那样。小李有很多同学是武警，有一部分是负责机场检查签证出关的，所以没有钱的小李不用签证出关还是有那么万分之一的可能性的。

在深山里，假设有这么一个地方，村落的村户七零八落的，为了防身，为了糊口，这么一户人家有一把枪。农村的院落不是很安全。如果身上有把刀子，会不会感觉到更安全。在英国留学的时候小李身上有一阵带着一把厨刀，英国交通工具没有安检，这把刀跟了小李很久，试听从新华社记者意见带的。其实利兹治安不好，英格兰人民性格暴虐，不是说别的地方治安就不好。农村的确是有枪的。在土耳其与乔雅咖啡国交界处，人们怎么能说第二次世界大战后旧的贸易道路封锁本国人民就没有咖啡喝了呢？这个地方房屋都是木头建造的，也近海。地处偏僻，物资匮乏。

农村很苦的，一碗方便面都是哄小孩的好食品。买个东西要走很长时间。城市的垃圾又总是漂到农村，山不清水也不秀什么都不方便。这样一个地方藏一把枪是很方便的。看到三鲜伊面包装上的那只鸡，打只麻雀也算。

https://www.mrporter.com/journal/mr-porter-eats/nordic-cooking-in-the-wilderness/579

小刘心里捣鼓，这个小李喜欢的女孩也是自己多年前的朋友，大家好久好久没有联系了，怎么就突然喜欢了。莫非小李有其他难言之隐不得不去加拿大。才看了地图，发林海雪原是加拿大的情况。都说只有周杰伦才有闲钱移民加拿大，就是的。两岸一旦开打，杰伦不是住的地方都没有了，他的公司肯定是租的房产。小李一直以为加拿大是林海雪原，加拿大和俄罗斯的不同之处是加拿大北边不住人，俄罗斯北边住人，还冬泳。冰原太阳很低的加拿大是没有人住的荒原，但是更像俄罗斯，这样低的太阳还能在秘鲁和伊朗看到，长长的影子。黑土地的肥沃更像是东北。加拿大的耕地是林地凯耕，集中在东南部。

这样维度的国家好像在漠河看北极光。

中国像一艘宇宙飞船似地加速飞行着。

时间很紧了。长得很帅的执行组长大叔不得不加紧时间昼夜办案。没有办法面对国外媒体的质疑。曹林讲，防火防盗防记者。国内记者一般不会关心这种案件的。国外的法院门前都站满了记者。省电视台不得不派了一个摄影老师全程跟踪。

穿着警服的有两个人，一个是执行组长，一个是差点去当保安又叫了回来的办事员。警服后面没有什么明显字样，远看去还以为是街上维持交通的协警或是保安。季洁从后面的阴影里闪出来。说：草这小子糊弄我们。到了地方又说想不起来了。小李和小马同时被捕。小马给小李背了个黑锅。小马说：我记得是个圆形树冠的树。这边的树都是长的。

在无声无息的宇宙里，曾今吃牛肉和牛奶长大的欧美人和曾今吃三鲜伊面长大的中国人，在拼比着财力，实力，国际影响力。如果没有对所在群体的贡献，很难被称作一个人，失业的人像一个废弃的零件，死去的宇航员，没用的船员，被扔进海里便是了。

在英国教堂的周天有免费的晚餐吃。大概有基金会管街上的流浪人员，这样还是有人在街上住。在中国有救助中心，不过报道很恐怖的样子。在厦门，在上海都能看到。虽然现在富了，但是有人吃住在流动厕所，西安厦门福州都能看到，之前还有报道讲有人家买了厕所改来住。还是挺恐怖的。去约旦的时候，见到大大的太阳下的垃圾桶有孩子在捡垃圾，觉得唉，钱这么值钱的国家孩子也这么可怜。相反，看钱同样值钱的古巴街上就很干净。

马路边上，会有赶路的人。我们称之为赶路，的确是在很古风地坐11路。无声无息地，他走向暗黑宇宙地深处。服务员在客人找茬的时候，经理会讲，没事，十年以后没人知道你在这里，你是谁，你曾经做过什么。没人会问你有多少钱，你像一个坏掉的零件，从这个大大大大的宇宙飞船上掉了下来，就再也找不到了。

最清楚的莫过于清洁工了，银行自动取款机的早晨，清洁工叫醒流浪汉，流浪汉收拾起自己的行李，去别处晒太阳了。

看过电影最后三日的人都知道，离开一个国家有很多原因，不得以离开一个国家多是政治和法律原因扯不清又是大麻烦。

小李比较口拙，说话意思表达不清，辞不达意，搞不就要给别人画图解释。大学的时候还联络过，来小刘家玩，似乎有数不尽的苍凉要诉说，两个男的在带床的房间里讲话，好别扭。

我们国家的枪支在警队里，少数猎场也有枪，押钞的有枪，发令枪也算的话，私人是不允许有枪支的。电影寻枪里讲阳光照不到的黑暗里有枪，普通人要枪做什么。

防身? 坐火车的话一把菜刀都难得带上，怎么带武器自卫。要么就所有人没有武器，要么就所有人都有武器，钢铁是怎样炼成的中保尔偷了枪，也给自己带来了麻烦。小刘是做办公室的，身上不带枪。片警身上带枪吗，也不带。

想到这里时，单身的小刘被路边小朋友的喷水枪溅到。他刚关了车门，回到空荡荡的房间。

这把枪是前两天从莲花池市场买到的，想去山里打点野鸡兔子小鹿，过下十八世纪英国人的生活。乾隆也有自己的猎场哦，电影巴莱克什么的真是刀刀见血，也是有自己的猎场的。小刘没事看资治通鉴，史记，是很有古风的一个青年。何况是西安人，带着匈奴的血。小刘想去打猎，多半是因为在他和小李均认为，男大当打猎，猎味最新鲜。这是件很原始的事情。男人是因为打猎而活着的。在他和小李心里，有那么一点流浪的，荒野的，气质。自由的，不负责任的，抛弃妻儿的躲避。

德国，加拿大，美国都是可以申请狩猎许可证的。国内可能不行。这么一点昂贵的特权，小刘想拥有，而且不想昂贵地出国去拥有。

忽略掉所有地合法申请程序，小刘给自己搞了一把，就像在美国买把枪那样。传说中芝加哥的枪战…… 小李不明白，有了战争，天灾时，人们会躲避，国内没有战争，没有天灾，钢筋混凝土不会无故砸下来砸死人；小李觉得这些高层实在是从香港传来的烂东西，因为高层就能在一片地皮上赚更多的钱，而且香港不会地震，而国内很多地方如此高层如此密集塞人进去，地震来了砸到了就人口减少了。其实有句最近很流行的新口号也大概是从香港传来的，小李有个在香港做律师的朋友很早以前这么说过。报纸上对着香港大加赞美，在深圳的时候望那边，海风里有臭味，夜色里那面的确繁华像金子在对着黑夜闪光，但是更有点妇人的气质，是很上海的。

同行三辆车。摄影记者和边境解放军做一辆车。季洁，警长和公诉大人在一辆车。挖掘的两个人一辆车。小马问司机要一根烟，司机正点着，被警长制止了。警长说：做事的人才给烟吃，你做了什么事，一晚上糊弄我们。

小马刚被季洁拳打脚踢的一顿。三辆车停在海边的野地里。解放军先生说我都算着公里数呢。季洁讲哦你算得清哦，不想跟着来被领导派来的。解放军先生讲要不要吃小食品，我在加油站带的。季洁讲有没有畅轻啊。

季洁在另一个暗处撒了泡尿，一个闪电，山石上的一个题字什么摩崖。很快雨下了起来。

如此议论，还是要写穷人的生活。穷人啊，就是交不到女朋友的人。就是陈奕迅别给我ICE TEA那首，女孩来到住处，家徒四壁。

很单纯的想法，开车去打猎。这是一把手枪。不坐公交没人会查。

偷窃的人多不是因为需要而偷窃，而是因为一直没有被发现而偷窃。私自拥有一把枪，就像洗碗阿姨辞职前拿了餐厅的很多盘子。

但是枪声是敏感的，想象一下发令枪响的时候，身体所有部位都不知所措，生怕自己被击中。车开到了江油，九寨沟，甚至汉中，并不是特别偏僻的地方，山里几声枪响，并不是投进水中的石头就此沉下没有后文了。

小李最近离小刘很近。小李一直没有工作，所以小刘出去打猎的时候会经常带着小李。一是犯罪现场需要同伙，二是小李口风紧，三是聊聊女孩的事，两个人都是大龄单身汉。

冰原上，只有安静和风速。小李和小刘盖了一栋木头房子。芝加哥有零下三十五度。加拿大的冰原上，小刘和小李拿出冷冻食品，开始油炸。两人喝着小酒。芝华士，男人的冰钓。

枪在一个度假山庄丢了。小刘用枪对着小李，因为小李悔了棋，又讽刺了小刘奋进公务员序列的动机。小李说您别，我还要去加拿大的。于是小刘把枪放到了自己的皮包里，继续下棋。这个度假山村是旧时的疗养院，面对着黑海，人们在这里做足疗。很多旧时的病人在苏联崩溃之后都没人管了，医院医生不得不自己掏腰包支持他们，可是医院也要倒闭了。

司机师傅给小马洗了脸上的血迹。长长树冠的树旁有棵苹果树。调皮的摄影老师知道夜里没得拍，吸着烟，和司机和公诉人聊起来。三个男人开始聊自己的生活。公诉人讲自己老婆死的早，死之前还说明了自己死亡的时间。这是一个很小的国家，地处内陆，和福建大小。周围的国家在打仗。

海风里，公诉人讲这种省城小地方不适合女人发展。

车灯照射范围内有棵苹果树。有人用手拽了下长着苹果的树枝。苹果掉了下来。半红半绿。树下有一条小河，很小很小。半红半绿的苹果顺着水流流到一个拐角，走不动了。拐角处有一个已经变质的苹果也躺在那里。要是没有外媒的压力，谁会去管这些烂掉的苹果。

遥远的海王星，离太阳最远，这样的地方，适合放逐和流浪，或者做永恒的太阳系卫士。

下雨了，众人上了车。季洁在后面坐着，有点困倦了。秃头的办事员开始讲案件。观众才明白这些的确是在办案的。同所的小刘失踪了很久，已经确定是死了。两个疑犯在被押着找尸体。大家嚷着要休息。司机说去麦当劳吧，晚上在麦当劳过，一人两百块吃过。警长说你要死了啊，去星巴克，五星级停车点还有个星巴克，一人一杯咖啡一个二十块以内的点心。他补充了一句，说那个姓马的没有份。

季洁说住店。说困了要睡觉明天没法搞的。办事员说那去我们大酒店吧。于是给保安长打了电话，几个车夜里冲进大酒店，开了栋能做饭的别墅。

枪详细的讲，是在度假山庄的酒吧丢的。度假山庄里有些省城的贵客，所以准备了些货真价实的洋酒。两人喝着咖啡，闲聊着一些小刘办案时的趣闻，吃着前一天打回来的小野鸡炖茶树菇，烧鹿筋，烤兔子头。餐厅的服务员把茶水倒上后，也把小刘的皮包搜过了，枪就这么不见了。森林里充满了动物和坚果，没有森林就意味着失去了陆上的吃的。虽然森林里充满了蛇，还有其他的大小动物，猪，鹿，大象。柬埔寨的鹿也是保护的，意大利人吃兔子，可能没有意识到动物的价值比吃掉本身会更高。

小刘发现后就毛了。好像自己的配枪丢了。但他又冷静下来，希望没有痕迹就好像自己没有枪一样。小李讲，我去加拿大肯定不是旅游签证，其实可以旅游一下脱团的变黑工的。他讲他不想那么样子。小刘说那可要七八年五六千万的，你能等吗。小李讲等锥子啊，我现在失业啊，我连房子都没有啊。小六讲哎呀那你要怎么办，彩票都没有那么大的奖。小李讲，你都有私枪了，我觉得混进加拿大可能也是和从餐厅拿个盘子一样简单。小刘讲那你那个盘子可得是国宝级的盘子，卖掉拿到钱，也不能等移民局给名额，要直接去贿赂拿身份，价格一样时间省了，好多办户口的都是这么搞的。

小李申请了布里斯托大学考古系的硕士。国家很给面子还弄了个交流项目，学费省了。小李是政法大学毕业的，不是北京大学。小李即使博士读出来了，有很难拿到学校的工作来支持自己的打猎生活。

小刘和小李还有个朋友叫小马。小马是高科技人员，属于极端武装牙齿的高精尖人员，就是比医生更那么精尖又重要人们又不得不花钱。小马有个朋友叫保罗。保罗在国内官做得很高了。平成四年，第一大太监篡夺皇位，扶持脑白金夫妇东征西战，简直是亚洲的拿破仑，霸占了俄国从芬兰到美国的两条铁路线。人们都奇怪太监做皇帝没有子嗣怎么办。

犯罪和贫穷的联系，一般人都会认为贫穷必犯罪。著名警探李琩钰估计也是这么想的，他的网络直播是收钱的，所有的大的科技公司的网络直播都是免费的。在警察眼里，加上所有的保安和看门狗，都会认为如果有了警棍，所有的过路人都是要硬闯机关大楼和私人宅邸的。仔细想想，这不是出于职位的负责，而是因为被赋予了什么魔法，就觉得可以修理别人。这是不很平等的。

这样写很不负责任。很多地方没有去过，没有办法写。很多人没有接触过，都是为了行文需要。但是读者看到了，尤其是青少年读者看报纸杂志，很容易被作者的语言文风和态度全部接受。特别是对于公众人物，基本上批评就是可以不负责任的。

如果没有遗产，家庭破碎，生活环境又很不在阳光下，是怎样的花朵怎样用心也很难培育成的。这时候需要一种秩序，一种逃离，一个保障，在公务员眼里，体制内望社会，就是从乱七八糟分离出来，终于上了岸。生活会像宫里的奴才那样按时按点。

小李就这样看不起小刘考入警察序列。乱七八糟，很丑陋很真实像个破掉的衣服上又镶满了珠子，否则县城里怎么都是上市企业。小李明白自己在这些洞洞里，小刘是那个穿着这件衣服的人。

小李讲，这个盘子在哪里，历史博物馆仓库吗？

大太监原先是中科院的。那是十年前的事了。小李才十九岁。十九岁的时候，小李拥有小野鸡般柔嫩的皮肤，面部肌肤吹弹可破。眼角也没有皱纹，虽然不洗脸不刷牙，但集体生活中还是又欧莱雅起码是香皂的每早滋润的。见过航天一中的中学生做中巴车上学吗，不是上海地铁里那种消费很高的中学生，是很纯的很纯的。这是一个让人心动的年纪。

十九岁，刚刚过性侵犯的定义。如果上帝在云端望着我们，他一定早让我们去死了。所以英格兰教堂大主教就讲，有时候我也感觉上帝睡着了。这么天价的房子，这么高的物价，这么紧张的节奏，其实什么都是新的，有点没有着陆摸不到。

如果上帝在云端看我们，他一定会给我们提示的。事实是，如果上帝要将大人于你啊，他必然会让你吃不消受尽苦头，然后站起来才是英雄。这是一个多么儒家的孟子的原话的套用啊。上帝其实在智利南端的山区里。当地人称山里的风速是上帝的怒吼。冰与火，完全不适合人类生存的贫瘠之地。生物却在这刀刃一样恶劣的环境中生存着。

小李觉得住在四季酒店才能听到城市澎湃的松涛，小刘觉得开着汽车才能体会福特的活得精彩，小马觉得女人的阴部是天堂的音乐，保罗觉得云端的感觉就是特效做得很好了。

这样的艺术是昂贵的。要欧洲的米开罗吉朗，达芬奇，罗丹，那菲尔，要日本的横平竖直古建筑。这样的逃离生活，这样在失业中十年一觉电影梦，我把青春献给你，屏风看海，是没有金熊奖不能平息民怒的。

一夜情却是便宜的，随处可得的。不远处便是酒店，觉得酒店脏，就在自家约小朋友。大太监那时还啃着今麦郎，请客吃饭还要用券，所有的性生活和生活的压力要在小野鸡身上发泄。那时候神并不远，西单就有海淀也有。纲常伦理，在就没了。礼坏乐崩，是一种很宇宙的未来感。

夜里面，所有的小厨师大厨师又被叫醒，羊腿，野菜，三文鱼全部招待办案人员。餐厅的经理被保安头子喝来叫去，像个文静乖巧的姑娘准备着餐后甜点。突然停电了。黑暗里不知谁摸了谁一把，谁大喊大叫了一阵。

小马被折腾了一天，也吃到了，现在被无限善解人意又美丽的餐厅经理一服务，无比感动留下了泪水。观众都认为那是忏悔的泪水，嫉恶如仇。

几个人出门抽了烟，三三两两私聊去了。公诉人和季洁聊了起来。季洁讲，你老婆死了都不尸检，怎么会说什么时候死就什么时候死。公诉人讲，生过娃就死了，当场。季洁讲，有一种药可以做到的，你只不过不想相信她会自杀。公诉人讲：我觉得我被原谅了，没想到关于我的外遇她怨念这么久。季洁讲是啊，你长得像杨朔似的，都以为你是美国演员呢。

小刘讲，这个枪是哪里来的？

小李讲，你那枪不是刚丢了吗，丢了你都不敢声张？

小刘讲，机场不时就有偷渡的，你偷渡好了，美国要60万，加拿大会便宜一些的。

小李讲，那是人贩子啊白痴，看过贾森斯坦里的电影吗，人贩子集装箱运人到欧洲啊。

小刘讲，一分钱一分货，收钱不办事不是道上的规矩。

小李讲，可别走黑啊，完全是没有消费者权益啊。我租了个房子，房东看着是黑过的，支付宝提醒我说对方账户异常，我当时想黑一下吧，于是就后悔不已房子问题百出押金不退。还是走正规机构吧。 

小刘讲，no pain，no gain。 你这么穷，不冒一下生命危险。

小李讲，你当我是股票啊，高风险高回报。

小李把枪在自己的皮鞋里调整了一下。他不明白自己为什么要这把枪。他觉得这个枪转手价钱不会低。半路上，他犹豫了下，杀死了小刘，把他的车也转手了。车带枪总共进账四万块。这样出了人命，国内是不能呆了。他没有护照，也不能出国。小李没有住处，他唯一的选择就是找人帮忙，不是住房局的问题，是国土资源的问题。

这是一种一个人丢失所有，在荒野里独自面对世界的苍凉。冷，冷到没有知觉，过去的错误就记不得了。原来他们都可以成为人的，现在却都是半人半鬼的状态。回不到故土，在雪原上伶仃。夜里像狼一样嚎叫着，痛哭着男人的心事。以前他们是有正道走的，只是礼坏乐崩，乱世罢了。三个男人在教堂里读着经文，仿佛找到了什么，放佛读了以后就不再是少数族裔外地人了。 

小刘也想在公路边开一块山石，出一片空地，建一座自己的三四层楼。问题是他没有那么多钱。小李知道很多人在打工做生意赚这份钱，他在建筑科技大学学的是历史建筑复原，他很敬佩古人用木头造房子的灰飞烟灭的不用爆破的方便于拆除。

这片空地，是所有的一切的值得守卫的，绝对不能失去的，所有的来源与归去。国家是最终的土地拥有者是件好事也是件坏事，具体的他们两个太年轻，讲不出更多。

每个人都想去对方的心里看一看，对方有时候给自己的小心灵断了网，就像一座绿岛那样横在福建对岸。倒过来看山山水水时，感觉所有的山石都浮起来了，水又飘在天空应有的位置，像东北的天那样低那样沉郁。其实我们的心是无极中的那个王宫，有十几层故宫似的红墙金瓦同心圆。那个小星球，只有自己的冰原看日出，太阳很低，影子很长，是一片空地，很农民的感觉。中国海水是黄的，少年派里海水是蓝的，有的海岸是沙滩，有的海岸是礁石，这池子水和这球形体的空气都是会挂沙暴的，人们真的应该移民到海里。深海里有的鱼根本没有视觉的，在某个国家的岩洞里，藏着很多淡水，这里的鱼也没有视觉。是非洲吗？

四万块，警察还没有来找他，多半是因为小刘刚调休。小李把自己的资料整理了下，四万块跑到了喀什，搞到了什么出入证，出了境。莫欺少年穷，有秩序还是比没秩序好，但是，乱世出枭雄啊。他显然是去不了加拿大了。 

他得到了一件宝贝，叫波斯王子的时间砂。

砂子只会发生作用，如果使用者是为了拯救世界不会被毁灭。

私人的打算，自己的想法，不能实现，是不是因为自己没有一颗拯救世界的心呢？先是拯救世界，再是安稳生活。技术和持久战，对于小小的穷光蛋小李，拯救世界也好，逃到桃花源也好，路远且艰难。

时间倒流了，他回到了大学毕业前的那个晚上。他选择不出国了，他选择去上火星时代的一万块的班，然后开始上班。拯救世界，他必须从此开始拯救世界不被沙暴掀翻，简单的讲就是北京从此没有沙尘暴。否则，他会再次走上杀人逃逸的路。

第二天，所有队员全血复活。昨夜就喊着睡觉的季洁没睡，和警长二人审了小马很久，最后怎么反而被小马感动了。给了他一支烟。

车走在阴天的山间，又回到了另一个野地里。一直狗叫了叫，把一个人头从土中抛了出来。昨天的雨下了一半，出了山就不下了。这片野地也是干的。挖坟的把尸体挖出来，发现五花大绑了。就是小刘的尸体。季洁和警长二人企图私用职权，痛扁小马第二次。季洁骂着：你这是个野兽啊。野兽派艺术家呀。人搞死了就算了，还要五花大绑搞死。警长道：枪呢，那支枪呢，为什么是射人的鸡巴。两人被拉住了。

爱尔兰充满了林子。林子里动物不多的样子。这样一个备受侵略的地方，人们并没有变成绿林英雄，而是移民了。

摄影大哥开始录像。公诉人说：观众朋友们，我们现在是在某省和谋省的交界处，更接近某省，死者，刘某某，尸体被发现。尸体完好，小便处有枪伤。手臂和脚被绑在背后。现在工作人员正在解除这些绳子。现场条件条件所限，不能进一步进行尸检。尸体现在被移送到国家医院。

小马嘟囔了一句他搞我老婆。

看着天上的枯掉的树木，冬天的漫长，如同一个助学贷款，在无尽的打工中，在低技能的工作中，在两三年农场林场的劳作中，累了就睡在田里，又因为做着很低贱的工作，负担不起昂贵的食物，交不到朋友，被人讨厌。这片枯掉的树，是最坏的，最坏的感觉，做了所有的努力还是不被认可。而最终，我们结束漂流，找到自己的安心之处，玩着开心农场的时候，青春已经不在了。小李认为的三十而立，其实就是三十而凑乎。您凑乎凑乎吧，这个十年啊，如此地动荡让人生厌。偷走的时间，空空如也，贫穷，贫穷，还是贫穷，不负责任的父辈们，温柔地藏匿了不怎么安全的贫穷和犯罪里唯一又安全感的枪，只留下了无力的年轻人一座空地和不见尸首的祖祖辈辈。

那个服务员真的是微笑着，趁小李不注意，收走了他睡觉都放在枕头下的刀。

后话。

“我以前是好过的，也试图更好，这是一个金子的时代，这是一个赶超的时代，这是一个炫耀的时代，不允许你没有人没有物没有正确的方向。‘’

“你值得拥有。“

尸体在医院迎接尸检，小马被枪毙。小李不知下文。季洁尸检的时候发现小刘呼吸道有土，是被活埋的。 这个案件没人管了。外媒追踪了一阵，某国警察私配猎枪反被杀。 

加拿大的雪啊，真够藏污纳垢的，小李感叹了下，不留痕迹地被释放了。

谁能说自己内裤上没有一坨屎呢。

刚吃了麦当劳。麦当劳就是所有本地传统餐厅的敌人。我很怀疑脸书创始人在意大利旅行吃麦当劳是不是作秀，因为人们到了意大利是不会在去傻逼兮兮的麦当劳，至少我不会。但今天我理解了这件事。我在闽南，我认为比闽北的菜要好吃一千倍，难做，讲究一千倍，结果上街什么都没敢吃，也没见到大馆子，连聚春园都没有，全是四川菜，东北菜如此，我的天啊，这是闽南啊，不是北京上海深圳啊。日。只好滚进麦当劳。事实证明这的确是又一个全国傻逼聚集地。这个福建的文化还是在福州，这他妈闽南没文化。 

宾馆倒是大了一倍。两年前是106吧。我不是很喜欢麦当劳啦。完全偏离这个小说的气氛了。厦门嘛。远华案。加拿大藏污纳垢的典型。我觉得小李应该已经完全明白了这个国家的房价，物价和这个国家自由之名下的各种问题。

这个事情需要在国外居住，长期或短期。

乔纳森海客儿是一个律师，刚刚结婚。他最近接到一个邀请，要从英国去东欧某国一趟。 他去了，当地人们都很恐惧这个他要去的地方。

这是一个城堡。去城堡的路上有狼。接待他的是发邀请的那个人。终于，他发现这是一个空的城堡，这个发邀请的人光线下没有影子，镜子里没有反光。律师没有办法脱身只好应付。

向发邀请的人解释了所有他要知道的法律事情后，律师被放走了。这个鬼运送自己和自己的棺材到了英国。他在英国有几处房产。

怪事情开始发生。律师的朋友露西死了。死了以后又夜里攻击婴儿。律师的几个好友在一位荷兰律师的指点下，明白了对手的弱点，把这个鬼赶出了英国。 

他们追击这个鬼，最终追击到了他的城堡。

这是一个没有阳光的叙述。黑暗的房间只有烟灰缸，电脑的屏幕和很多书籍纸张。还好房间在某大楼顶层，很大，有落地玻璃窗，像一个新的火车站那样半圆形的玻璃墙，很安静。窗外是纽约。

博士要回国了。博士的博士还没有读完，听说在多伦多大学学习的博士有延期读不出来的，博士这个博士论文就菊花相当紧了。

三年过去了，这是多么大一篇论文啊。家乡的老人每月都给自己寄地方志过来，让他不能忘记自己是中国人。这是容易忘记自己国籍的地方，是的，这是。他学的是古典文学，西方古典文化。西方人都不一定会学的专业。他最喜欢的作者是美国一个写侦探小说的。

回国是花费很多的。机票，礼品，幸好他不是同性恋，否则是肯定不愿意回国了。思乡吗？是的，这里买不到孜然。就是有时间，有闲钱，突然想回国一趟。机票买了下周的，无疑很贵，礼品去高档商店买了很多衣服。两年没有回国了，孤独。毒品，性乱，枪战，每天都像一部低俗小说。他很幸运这些低俗没有烧到自己这个楼顶。唯一抵抗的，他有抵抗吗？他难道没有在拥抱这些吗,他根本不介意别人用毒品，他自己就性乱，他倒是没见过枪。他嫖过。

他不想念家乡的食品，他有点喘不过气，身体不适，感觉自己可能不适应这么多烤的的东西，总有点上火。特别是，不适应这样自由自在无拘无束无人理会。在国外独居很可怕的。

夜很长。纽约很冷。他看着要过年了，又在网上订了张火车票。事实是他的论文卡住了。他才不想趁着春运。第一次出国，时间有点久了。上一次只是在香港开了会，不算回国。

他下楼，走过十几条街，到一家福州小吃店。他不在外面吃饭的，每天花两小时做饭。他要了一碗猪肝面。那个碗是沃尔玛的十几美元一个。一个打扮像李宇春的女孩在窗边，窗外一个打扮奇异的男的把一张带着女孩头像的纸砸在窗上，对了名字，两人离开了。

他要付钱，发现钱包丢了。一个人拿着他的钱包正往门外走。里面有所有的证件，shit。

博士追出三条街，那人滑入地铁站的厕所，又从厕所冲出来把博士撞倒，消失在人海里。没钱，没钥匙。没证件，谁叫您把所有的essential都装在一个gap买的钱包里。这时博士穿着一双阿迪，篮球短裤，一个夹克，一件毛衣，给房东打电话。电话没电了像一块砖头，没带充电器。shit，今晚去哪里。

他被操控了。平日都不在外面吃饭，夜里也绝不出门的。天机一动想来吃猪肝面就走了一个小时。孤独是孤独者的墓志铭。

他想起一个朋友，大概知道住址，不远，于是走过去敲门。没人应。他就坐在青苔的石阶上。这时门开了，一个亚裔男孩说再见出了门。他的朋友看到了他，表情复杂，博士进了门，意识到这位爱尔兰朋友在一个奇怪的情绪中还没换过来，就讲：你们公司的那个产品介绍我想再看一眼，突然有点思路。爱尔兰人讲：以为你只会写解说词呢。

博士就这样在一个周末的凌晨在别人家里蹭吃噌喝了一夜。

第二天，博士搭顺车到了警察局，银行，办理了临时证明，回国刚好补办护照。

在国外就多了一张牌。你可以对国内的种种不听不问。你甚至可以很刺激地浏览反动网站而不必自律。这样有不同的声音，很利于认识事情的全面。事情总有另一面。

两年没见面，快三年，人们彼此会生疏的。在国外又多了一张牌，在国外本身就是一张牌。不联系的人听说了这个还是会因为信息交流的缘故来见面的。没有人会选择被蒙蔽，看。

出国又意味着很有钱很成功。没有人会拒绝和有钱又成功的人做朋友。所以回国意味着很多的饭局。

第一顿饭是和一个在上海做地产的朋友。朋友讲自己在陆家嘴的楼前几年失了两百万，这两年正以每年一半的速度赚回来。是在一家叫铜锣湾的餐厅吃的饭，吃的却是浙江菜。同学其实是警察，松江大学城的片警，专管学校的。手上有几处房产，所以每日打牌也可以收租。两个人颇为夸张地在餐厅吹嘘着，散伙后博士感到无比害羞。

第二顿饭是和一个东北的同学吃的，大学时候的上下铺。同学抱怨着温州的房价已经涨到了两万一平方米。同学正在温州发展，准备买房子。很久很久很久没见面了。最后一次见面大概是毕业前一个月，最后一次吃饭都记不清了。很尴尬的见面，博士感觉同样在国内读博士的同学会抢了自己风头，很容易被比较，特别是在国内会更well connected。

第三顿是和那个寄地方志的老爷爷吃的。其实长大期间老爷爷一直不怎么来往关心的，现在被称为老朋友，实在是出于礼貌。老爷爷趁四下没人，说裤子脱了，小鸡鸡给我看看。博士只好顺从，装作自己无知，只是看老人家德高望重年龄大，也是对晚辈的一种爱。

这个年龄家里开始物色结婚了。一般是美国的博士配英国的博士。博士的妈妈给博士介绍了一个美国硕士，也在纽约，说怕读书寂寞。这家颇为开放，博士说慌了。博士一看照片，似曾相识的感觉。说，妈你太费心了。博士的母亲讲给你介绍一个同乡，要不你们两个人都会陪白人黑人乱睡觉的。博士说我找酒店的卡片的。博士的母亲说那能靠谱，比酒店客房还脏。博士说那样画面不会很好看，太文弱了。

父亲是政府官员，每年有很多机会出国和其他国家的省市政府交流。也去纽约看过博士。父亲讲你学的这个回来只能教书，还不是那种很热门的老师。早早准备，我认为你在国外找不到很技术岗位的工作的，因此，如果你和美国人情意绵绵，你是要隔绝之苦的。你除了写书做电视，工资不会很高，成功几率小，基底很厚但不见得会找到畅销的机会。

博士回答讲，你是靠政府吃饭的，你哪里懂赚钱的事。

如此，博士被一顿毒打。博士心里很希望父亲能陪自己多一点，更认可自己，但父亲对自己很冷漠，即使自己争取，也难见笑容。

家里有几亩良田种着水稻，水田里养着鲤鱼。博士坐在长满茶树的山丘上，风干着眼泪。没过一会春雨开始了，母亲熬了粥，青黄不接的春天来了，油盐炒了芽菜，水泥院子里有昏黄的灯和过年剩下的食品，自己伤心了一会，就忘记了。有一片土地，这是最生生不息的事。

博士有论文在身，很快回到了纽约。第一件事是大逛书店。国内机场火车站甚至没有一个书店，街上除了新华书店就是中小学教辅，一本对的书，是不会出现在旧书铺，不会出现在图书馆，网上或许能买到。但是，与其用亚马逊跨洋过海代购，还不如自己来逛书店。总会有对的书出现在一堆不对的书里。博士买了一本英国小说家在巴斯投店的小说，又买了一本英国诗人写的自传。在自传里能看到很多地方志。

这个母亲讲的美国硕士，那天丢钱包的晚上见到了。命运真是充满巧合。博士给他打了电话，说父母介绍最靠谱的。

见面在一家西班牙餐厅。博士是文弱的，硕士是长相平平的。这是一次无聊的中文交谈。交谈过后，两人均认为费城和纽约连接在了一起，从此可以有沙发睡了。两人都没有讨论对方的性生活，博士租的住处大，自然是大哥。对方读的是犯罪学。

过了三个月，博士给硕士送了手表，也把硕士送回国了。

父亲心脏出了问题。博士要捐心脏。

### 15 Young Chinese financier made a copy of himself.

Night person, hate daylight, he is kind of out space person. In the future, the sun is dead. Earth has been polluted. Only moon light and stars. Nothing is growing.

Looking for friends. 1. Talk. 2. Share rents. 3. Sick, drunk, in trouble, in grief… 4. Do sports. 5. Debts of 30000rmb and it mountains itself

Things happened in the past has been dusts… They will never exist again. Regretting is like living in sorrows and memories. It is a good way to let your competitors stop.
Billy Yin is a night person. He hates daylight. He is kind of out space person. In the future, the sun is dead. Earth has been polluted. Only moon light and stars. Nothing is growing.

Billy Yin took a lunchbox to work. He got up early. It was still dark. His dad just called him to go back home to sell toilet. He could imagine that he sent name card to his friends: Billy Yin, sell manager in shower, toilet and basin solutions.

Years after his struggle in Shanghai, he thought that his dad was right: a private toilet is everything to pass the cold winter in the city with no heating. He took two chicken filets from the old fashioned fridge, cut them into some chunks, quickly stir fried the Sichuan spicy chicken, put them into his lunchbox, hurried out with toothpaste still on his mouth. Billy Yin lived in Pudong, he had to be quick to catch the sunrise and first bus and then subway.

His sister was on the morning bus’s small annoying screen. Sometimes he could see her reporting in a hurricane affected Pacific country. While her face was pushed by the wind, and sometimes hit by burgers: cheese, beef, tomato, bread, yes, hit, Billy Yin was nicely enjoying the joy of garlic from baozi in the morning bus. Bloody hell. He said. Could you stop eating spring onion, garlic and pork… His sister had a style of dressing: more and more like the BBC reporters: big piece of clothes cut in shapes and neatly seamed. Billy Yin was wearing suits: he had to, he got clients to meet.

The bus began to stop and stop in jams. Once his sister said directing movies could have some privileges as every hit movie could let stupid assholes think years after years. Billy Yin didn’t watch movies. He was a theater goer. In movies actors sometimes did art, but in theaters actors are really making art. Thinking like that, he hit a button in his half robot body, time stopped. He wanted to fuck a girl with a flower like dress opened to him. It was morning, he somehow felt great need to fuck someone. He opened her dress, put his hand into her pant. He then finished his intend, left some liquid and seeds into another body.

He fastened his belt, got back to where he was standing. He clicked the button again. The farmers from all other parts of China presumed to ask the Shanghainese in Shanghainese: what’s the next station? Then Billy Yin got off the bus, flushed himself into a carriage, stuck himself with his phone for another 15 minutes, then he found he left the lunchbox somewhere near the seat of the girl he had fucked.

He remembered that her breasts were full and the nipples were not soft. She was on when the time stopped. The girl had the need to be fucked. Half robot Billy Yin could see through that. The girl’s licks were not sweet and her teeth were not white. Though small and thin, she was not the perfect egg for the seeds.

A man needs to be settled into a woman’s body. It’s like the fucking building where Billy Yin was working in. Officialism, white shirt, finance, money, investment, business, consultancy, funds, suits, mugs, papers… fake or real businesses filled the city. While, not all of them could afford a nice office building. Some were in stock market, some were not in stock market, and Shanghai Security Newspaper was absolutely something Billy Yin used to sit on on dirty public seats. Billy Yin was working for a real financial company. The building was horribly unnoticed with no FamlilyMart around. It was a branch of British Business Review, whose building was also sitting in a corner of unnoticed London.

While, after ten minutes in work, just waiting for Bloomberg Terminal opened, a notification disturbed the genius Billy Yin. His seeds got into the egg and another copy of the machine was planted into another human flesh. Billy Yin didn’t have a private toilet in his rented countryside house. He peed into the bottles from the drinks. He had no kettle. He had no tea sets. It was rainy and planes were passing by. A kind of sadness and lonely came and came again together with the cold autumn chill. He was not alone now. He had a copy.

Cottons, vegs were planted near Shanghai. The girl got fucked felt hungry, ate the packed lunch she found on her right hand. Her blood became green. Her red meat exploded after the fast growing process of forming the machine organs. Half digested Sichuan chicken breast with rice were found by the police later.

The sun had died. Dark clouds with heavy polluted mist covered the whole region. Though Shanghai was said to be the last port of light, it had fallen into the enemies’ control. Billy Yin’s company sighed a contract with the space ship institute. He had to prepared for a three months working in the dessert.

The host of the news channel had a live broadcast and a big coverage on the triton exploration project. The host was naked, because the studio was too hot. He sat there, with a touch screen on the glass table in front of him and a box of three flavor ice cream with a plastic spoon. His watch was shinning, a piece of jewel was also shinning. People could afford air conditioner no longer if it cooled down by one degree, the outside’s temperature could be higher by two degree: no one wanted to put an ice box into a heated wok. The host was under a huge pressure as he was from another region, couldn’t pronounce the Shanghainese well. So when the camera switched to other videos and audios, he quickly asked his assistant about the right pronunciation. He didn’t wear any because the region was poor and no sponsor want to provide the clothes. His skin had been newly changed which also needs air and light. Everyone understand it: it is ok to be naked for any reason. Miles away, Billy Yin’s sister poped up into the camera frame. She was in a space suit. She looked not being able to control the gravity. When she wanted to walk, she was jumping. Oh, what a wonderful place for flying and sword fighting. She put a flag of China onto Triton’s land, but she was not the first one there, astronaut had been there long time before a journalist could travel there.

Later when she became Swedish officially and the mysterious death of his brother happened, she finally stopped draining resources from the mother Neptune. Her long lemon yellow hair was yielding in the moon’s air. The host said one line which make all the audience laugh: Oh, please tell me you would like to have a nice drink, hot bath and stop using public money for expensive travelling for a second.

That made Billy Yin laugh too. He owned no toilet of his own. He had to rest for an hour before cooking his dinner. Working on the space project could be better, at least it was state money and no crowded bus, no unrelated people, no fuck on a bus, no playing phone on subway: absolutely heaven’s job. Having made his last phone call which he deliberately prolonged, other colleagues had left. He called the girl he had fucked in the morning.

Sorry, I left my lunchbox near you seat on the bus this morning. Could you kindly to give it back to me?

Oh, who’s this? I did, ate the rice and chicken from an anonymous lunchbox. I threw it.

Shit, oh I mean thank god, are they tasty? I have to buy the Family Mart sushi today.

Then the girl exploded after screaming.

Good evening, my copy.

### Middle age businessman was a pervert.

“duty first”. Mr Muffin is a “just” person. He is so morally right. When seasons change, he notices the sun is leaving the north. Though cold weather is good for health, a tiredness person like him would like to go to the Tibet to enjoy more sunshine. After meeting and mating the Welsh man, he has a strange smell of black feather, a smell of death. His flesh disappears during nights and regain its shape during the day. Being in a relationship is brutal, esp. for men with a fortune. He begins, restarts his habit of sleeping with strangers for body pleasure. Can’t resist it. Can’t ignore it. -Interview with Luke Evans.

Man fucks man, this man is conquered. Man fucks woman, this woman is conquered. These is no woman alone that could survive. Men are born bigger and stronger. Women are born smaller and therefore in need for protection.
When Mr muffin was rich, he lived in hotels like a joke, and threw money like shit into the deep hole.
Men kill men and get their women…it’s normal.

adWhen Mr Muffin knew that he could not die, he wanted to live, come back to life. Life needs water and sunshine. A dried flower could open again in hot water, and, if there are enough sunshine, it grows quickly. He struggled to find the ingredients, conditions to come back to life, but that was hard, he took years to find the right kind of pineapple. Then he gave up, knowing that it is a one way ticket only through the life and death door. He had something unfinished, so he could not two feet in death to another world to meet his long lost lover.

He had to finish the things, so he could die in peace and disappear. There was no home, just the end. His options were pageup and pagedown the hundreds of long years of living as a shadow. He had been an excellent cook, as he knew the things growing on earth quiet well, and had seen many of them becoming protected animals. He was also an excellent builder. Men verse nature, he had seen so much, and had learned so much. With the devil’s strength, he could force rocks and woods and cut them, freeze them, heat them to form anything he wanted. He knew well about how gravity works and how things get along with each other. He could summon storms and mist.

He was the kind of “duty first” guy. Once programmed with missions, though the owner had died, the robot would still continue working on the missions. As a businessman from cloth to construction materials, he was not a money oriented person. He immigrated to Ireland in 1997, and had worked in software companies for years. He held a jewel design master degree so due to his natural interest, he needed gold, silver and other metals to put diamonds in. He found China had made itself the largest exporter of gold. He would like to get a deal with the gold mines to maintain a cheaper supply of gold. The only thing he was expected to exchange for the deal was a praise, like the one a teacher gives to a small child.

Mr Muffin secretly hid his immigration from his dad who was Swedish. His dad was very well educated and had always been in academic. His dad described research like fishing in the pacific. If the fisherman wanted tuna cans to export to China, they had to face the waves and sharks. Mr Muffin thought his dad was good looking with beard all over and captain like. The navigator, his father held the wheel in the sea of waves. Layers of dark clouds covered the blue sky and sharks were all around. They had to kill one shark to pay for an IMac, or they needed to catch lots of other fishes. The boat had been turned upside down. Mr Muffin and other strongmen managed to turn the boat back. Then they were took by a helicopter to a larger steel ship, where they caught a shark successfully, that was the only warmth and light they get in the cold Pacific: efforts got paid. Back to the fish market, the old Muffin Tin was relaxed and happy.

Mr Muffin Tin’s long lost lover was photographed naked with detailed private place exposed by a Welsh photographer. The girl was raped and murdered. It was snowing. The murderers were cornered by him on a beach. Foams, waves seagulls. They fought. Then during the ages of getting old, the lonely man kept sculpting the young lady, which made his wife very angry. They were married and he promised to build a governor’s mission, park, big house with lots of rooms, and for her. While, what he got was another woman.

The Welsh man with Mr Muffin didn’t know that this lovely short Chinese middle aged, was not only a dick sucker, a sodomy lover, but a blood drinker. During their gay sex in thousands of ways, legal or illegal, group or not you could imagine, Mr Muffin had been capable to avoid any sex transmitted disease which, even for the British with free medical care is a hard job. Literally, losing a hand or a half a head, they would grow out again for Mr Muffin. His only problem was the sunlight. He knew the weather very well and felt it proper to follow the sun to Tibet during winters, his responsibility of protecting the good, the harmony, sometimes led him to get burnt. As a lawyer, you could not get burnt. He ate human food, shit, and kept a large supply of wine with O, B, A, AB, goat, lion…labeled.

Mr Muffin knew he was only a shadow. Long time ago, he was a king with his servants and armies. He had been a cunning communicator. He once was a journalist, spreading fake news, lots of his news were exaggerated and false. He then became a consultant for politicians. He trusted no one. He did lots of research.

Looking at the reflection of the sky in a pond where golden and red fishes were kept, he remembered all the people died in politics. He liked the Himalayas where one continent hit another. It’s green. Waterfalls. A feast of plants he liked. He knew the harshness of the nature itself and the wrath of god. The earth was young, then prehistory activity of humans, then the classic time of his. He stood on the side of humans. He knew humans love nature as long as they are in an all glass ball: not getting wet, not getting harmed. He also felt he is not one of them.

Life forms on the earth are one way only. Lots of people come and go in Mr Muffin’s long life.

### Old professor told about his war experience.

HONG KONG (Google)
Monica Lin was studying French. After years of teaching in China, she got a job in Canada and met the first French. Shen then opened a restaurant in Vancouver. 
Her young husband, 21, has been a head in McDonald’s in Spain, gay though. Professor Muffin Tin, 74, is an airplane expert. He helped the young man with a degree in engineering.

HONG KONG (Google) Monica was studying in French. After years of teaching in China, she got a job in Canada and met the first French. She then opened a restaurant in Vancouver.

Her young husband has been a head in a McDonald’s, gay though. Professor Muffin Tin is an airplane expert. He helped the young man with a degree in engineering.

Covel Greenwood was based on my previous landlord in Fuzhou in Fujian province in China. He fell for his second son, Dawei, who has the most beautiful face the dad has ever met. Does he want to sleep with his second son? He always doubted. He designed a way for him as a combination of a baker and fisherman. He wanted his second son tender hearted, sweet and of lots of courage. On the contrary, the boy turned out to be too plain with no gift. While the first son was making a good life with his tongue, the second could hardly finish any adventures. He has to stay at hometown where wages are lower.

After years of separation, he finally arranged a meeting with the boy, a subway engineer in Shanghai. It was after midnight. In a VIP area, two young sleepy boys were serving the food. Mr Dawei was pretty old then. He didn’t wash his hand, bought a swiss roll and instant noodle. He was working on a new branch of subway in the netting process of Shanghai. Mr Covel was on his way to Russia and the other four countries in north Europe. He was in transit with a 72 hour pass visa. His son was still catching him. Mr Dawei looked like a deer in the night’s perfect light. His skin was white. His face was clearly created and positioned with thin a thin brush. He took the cake out of the package. He didn’t mind that the dustbin’s lid was dirty. He opened it then threw the package. Mr Covel wanted to hold his son’s hands. He knew that he must have suffered a lot. He could imagine that working on a subway’s construction, his son sometimes didn’t shave, with a bar of smoke on his hand, under a tight schedule, looked terrible. Mr Dawei was sleepless during nights. He didn’t order anything special for his meeting with his dad. He didn’t treat him as his dad. It was his normal every night meal. His smell of body, his shyness during teenager years, his well grown breasts, his easiness, had become framed pictures which Mr Covel finally got lost in the sea of people.

Professor Muffin Tin watched his wife’s corpse being burnt with the rest of his railway neighbors in the McDonald’s. He then remembered that during all these years of being abroad, he had never bought a Gucci scarf for his wife. He then went to a Gucci shop, asking for a silk scarf under 10000 renminbi. The patterns were flowers and birds. They are one piece of drawing and didn’t repeat. He then boarded a plane with the scarf for his dead wife. It was cold on the plane. He wrapped himself in the scarf like a wallpaper. My wife is a pig, a hog, a swine. Yes, she was the most disgusting creature. Every day the former chef went to shopping, he stared at the pork, asking for lamb. Pigs eat their own shits. He and his wife slept in separated rooms. When they had sex, he punished her to make her cry. The day he wanted finally to kill his wife, he did some research on how to kill a pig. Bloody hell, he stared at the smelly, laughing, shouting, nightmare like people shopping, quarrelling, bargaining in the grocery area; and suddenly a very fat girl under ten just ate a very thin middle age struggling man.

The battle of Westfall happened when Professor Muffin Tin was very young. The then cornbelt of China was the old royal lands. The place was not very successfully looked after and threats turned the once rich farm land into an environmentally fragile place. After the Taiping occupation of eastern Jiangsu, old Shanghai was swelled with refugees. Foreign banks and companies got into China during 1912 to 1935, when the country was trying to build itself. Professor Muffin Tin was following the government’s post to protect northeast China.

It was a bloody battle. Godsent. Godsent. They could find spring onion, ginger root, garlic and red chilies. Ginger roots were not peeled and had been washed. Garlics were pink and white. Potatoes, mangos, fish, chickens, sesame, vinegar, soybeans were also growing. They wanted to make it slow so people would have time to think if they were being followed. There was little possibility of a win, like a girl who loves football and has devoted herself into the sport but with little possibility to get funded and win a medal. His skin was white, then turned black after a summer. He absolutely loved the country. Waves after waves of enemies were pouring in. He was swift, wearing a pair of light, knee height leather shoes. He was underage for a war like that. He used fire well. He was good at traps. He took an afternoon’s time, none stop, waiting for the enemies to be poisoned. He added things little by little. He killed 40 per night. Blood was everywhere so they had to clean it every hour.

892bca48684509.589ea077855b8There was a plane coming to pick people to leave. Professor Muffin Tin never think of leaving. Once captured, it could be slavery. After the war, Paris was spared physical destruction, while Shanghai was in Diminish, professor Muffin Tin had to go to China Town to cook. He went to Sichuan and cooked a very good Sichuan spicy chicken. I have always thought that myself has been the drought boy waiting for a fire ring, while, I am not. I was born as a monster and would be a monster to seduce and kill for a living. I grab the unfortunate boys into the bottom of the pond for some changes to have food. Once noticed that I am the bread scrub, I made myself into a meatball and when I was juicy in others’ month, I was crying. Time, time, catch every deadline but can’t avoid a careless slip. The clock in my hand dropped onto the ground, like a 5D Mark 3 dropped onto a concrete ground, into pieces. The liquid of time is gone. Mark is always absent on a voyage. Monica is like deaf in the French restaurant. Kill everyone in your way, then you could see the bloody way out. There is no fire ring. It’s your own bare hand with a knife robbing everyone.

Mr Muffin was so mean that he didn’t want to share anything with anyone. He just wished that his forever glass car would run forever, no matter how the earth and humans change. He behaved like a man driving a car with the windows shut. Even when he could actually see that he had hit a man, he pretended that he was hearing and feeling nothing and there was nothing under the car. He just ran away.

He was half dead. Living men are like a plus. Dead men are like a minus. He was zero. Autumn leaves began to fall. Rain one after another. Boys wore shirts outside their t shirts. He lived in the Himalayas’ most luxury building’s highest floor. His only friend was living in another hotel 200 meters away. His building was four seasons estate’ product. He just landed his paper box onto the roof. His only friend was an actor, living in the five floor hotel’s 5th floor. His friend looked at Mr Muffin’s paper box in the cloud with the shinning logo of the estate company in early morning. His friend was not lucky. He was poor. So he wrote a letter to Mr Muffin, a house owner. Mr Muffin didn’t reply. It was eight years after they graduated from a wizard school. Mr Muffin had years and years of fortune. His friend looked at another not so fancy a department between the two buildings, thinking that it was not right to stare at the shinning things in the city center.

After twenty years, his friend became a successful actor. He moved out of the Himalaya’s where there was no electricity, no water and no gas. He did remember sometimes there was no paper box on that highest building. He thought it was the clouds. He now lived no longer in crowded, 3*5 no window, noisy hotel rooms. He lived in private land with a singer house in Beijing. No one could disturb him. He had been in roles in many films. Mr Muffin somehow became a poor guy. He sold the paper box, had to do hard shipping jobs for a living. He contacted his only friend he had lost in the sea of people. The actor said, you were cheating me twenty years ago. You didn’t have the house in the most luxury building. They told me the highest floors were always only affordable for foreigners.

They knew each other. They were the only two of the kind that could not die. Mr Muffin had a team of five and he had to record what was happening on this planet. He switched from the mountains to the sea after three episodes. There was still only a 0.5*3 meters window in his box where he kept his coffin, soil, plants, clothes, films and bath. When he chose shield on, the box would be invisible and free from any harms, like a gay in closet.

Mr Muffin was a king. Not like Professor Muffin Tin who had limited time left and had been slow needing young lovers to take him to parties, Mr Muffin did not like the noisy night clubs in Bristol. He had several properties in the England. He was excellent in cooking, excellent in building. He was a master and could master anything men had invented in the war with nature. When he talked with men, he must have had an intention: blood, or money.

Flying in times is like a shadow into anyone’s life. Today he is a normal guy on a bus, tomorrow he must be witnessing volcanos and waves. Eight years, Billy Yin had earned 400000. His only friend killed himself many times while wondering in the woods of mushrooms that could not be eaten, hungry in the dark, wet, narrow forest of art which a poor country could not afford. Mr Muffin was cunning. He knew that art needs money. He did trading rather than art. Once, he was in his car, noticing the actor, his only friend in the world, was walking on the walkway, with breakfast of a bun and soybean milk, hurried into a theater for small roles. It was raining, raindrops were on his window. His friend just disappeared into the dreaming world. He understood fully why his friend was suffering. Eight years ago, his friend chose to do art and art needs money. Then his friend only dreamed to be rich but never had a well paid job. Mr Muffin thought like this while his plane landed in Ireland. Same kind of rain and plants, but full of seagulls and sausages.

He just couldn’t open his car to tell his only friend that being immortal is a curse and in order to live against life and death, one had to be real. One had to know how much a nail cut is and how much a cabbage is. Cooking itself defined civilization. When his friend ate in cheap restaurants and stalls, poor guys around were like worms and snakes feeding themselves. When later he tried cooking, he didn’t feel that he was a monster with no intelligence. While when he was lost in stories, costumes and scenes, he could even not read the instruction before using his phone.

Mr Muffin had a doctor, his father who was an environment expert. Mr Muffin had a designer who was a specialist in weapons and tools. Mr Muffin also had an engineer who made robots and dolls: humans are Mr Muffin’s pets and research objects. When humans wanted to study from birds to make planes, they were actually like the birds: they had to move their wings very quickly to fly over the mountains with the flocks; they look funny and not smart. Mr Muffin knew that humans could understand and learn from the past and could measure. He controlled them to collect information.

A deer, humans is only a deer in Mr Muffin’s planet earth. His actor friend once was in Mr Muffin’s business. He was given a job. But when movies were on, he was told to chase his dreams on a phone screen or translated cinemas. Then he couldn’t get up at six in the morning to catch the morning bus and he thought it was not his right job. Mr Muffin just wished his best friend best luck in this old world where there is no light but only sandstorm.

He sipped tea and it was raining or heatwaves outside the paper box. He could see that through the long narrow window. His friend finally got famous and rich as an actor. His best friend’s rehearsal room was just under his paper box. It took time. If we don’t want to compromise on the look and the quality of the life we build for ourselves, we have to wait. Even these guys who could not die need to wait.

Monica Lin, who has a whole English world of her own, was sexy, beautiful. The French young boy, could never bear seeing people starving, was happy with a free internet. When Monica Lin was in Spain for her Spanish course, the young boy was a teacher in a museum for children group visits. Monica Lin knew that she might disappear as a tiny particle of sugar into hot water in the new world. She took one thing from China: a chef certificate. Professor Muffin Tin had taught students for a long time as his career. The old man was a crazy fan of a Taiwanese band. Monica Lin finally had an office job. The young boy had an engineer degree. A cake, card, flower shop was opened.

The eldest daughter of the newspaper editor was working as the father’s assistant. The restaurateur was strong and fit. He is rich like Carrefour’s boss. When people are poor, they must keep themselves happy, or they could do nothing with a bad mode. The restaurateur became poor in a night’s time, as poor as the French boy who was picked up by Professor Muffin Tin from Paris’ street. He had enemies in politics. In the country he came from, there was no free internet.

The eldest daughter of the editor one day lost her golden ball into a well. She asked a frog to pick it up for her in exchange to kiss the frog. The restaurateur had nothing under his name and ugly indeed. All he could manage to get is to play with rich people’s kids to keep an income. Monica Lin took away fried noodles from the Chinese buffet on the other side of the bank. Then hung up the phone call from Mr frog. She was from to school in Canada and had worked for top companies. She could teach doctor students. The old king was a great fan of the famous restaurateur who was once rich and now poor. He wanted her daughter to have an interview, and take photos of the frog for the supplement. He forced his daughter to keep the promise as the frog had found the golden ball.

The eldest daughter refused the proposal from the restaurateur. The restaurateur said, I am a sailor, I fight with the sea and weather to get my money and fame. I won’t be around all the time. I promise you that every time I hear your call from wherever on this planet, I would be present with the speed of light. The daughter said, you are not good enough for me. You can’t even speak French. Kill yourself. Then she threw the frog onto the wall. Small business owners in the country where the cursed prince was from were heavily taxed that year. Nothing from cakes to flowers to cards were profiting. They threw the government down that night.

Mr King got his interview and news. The daughter found herself mean. She was presented a heart of gold. Never judge a man by his possession.

Chinese food means a lot. Rainy, sell myself in the age women were not independent and travel was difficult. Study English, end up in receptionist. Wait for an old man’s help. There is nothing in this world that money could not buy, not to say a citizenship.

Marrying to a foreign person is like “voyaging the pacific alone” and, to say goodbye to childhood. It often ends up in disaster in reality. When the old man is dead, the only warmth is from a fucking husband. Oh, fuck oneself.

Mooncake festival was coming. It was raining and there was no moon. Monica Lin had been sick for a long time. She asked the servant to open the window for her. She had a feeling that she could not live till the end of the year. The French boy was still in university for the degree. Study was hard. He was full time study. His financial status was like a paper made umbrella caught in heavy wind and rain. He could not afford to pay before eating a bowl of rice. He took shelter in small temples and helped by his teachers. He always said: oh, good sister Monica, you are the goddess. Monica Lin died. She asked the servant to put her carefully framed self portrait near the rock in her garden. The family moved, left the garden. When the French boy visited the garden, he found the painting. The dead Monica had a reunion with the French boy in capital city. They rented a house. The boy became rich and powerful of high social rank en la fin. The illustrations of this story were painted by French brand pencils and water color, made in Kunshan, a small city on the skirt of Shanghai.

### 17 MR MUFFIN SHOT VIDEOS IN POTAGONIA FOR BILLY YIN. – INTERVIEW WITH HUGH, MICHAEL AND JAMES

Mr Muffin was driving a Ford. He heard that people were calling John the baptizer the angle for the hungry and poor, then he heard that people were calling him the lord for the sick. In his mind, from his classic time, he had betrayed too many people. He could hear them cursing him.

Winds, pine trees, he could hear them in his four season hotel’s highest floor bedroom. He didn’t like sunlight at all. Wherever he went, he brought a cloud of mist with him. People say he is dark, truly because there had been too much darkness in his memory.

Mr Muffin was born and raised in great Turkey land, where the sea and mountains are both not far. So when people want protection, they hide in father mountain. When they want to risk there life for flowers of the sea on the seabed, they dance with sharks and dive into the water that covers 71% of the earth: they go back to mum’s body.

He remembered that the first car was invented by Mr Ford and the first lamp was invented by Mr Edison. He could not drive as he was too used to horse carriages. He could command horses. He could not control machines. So, he gave up and hired drivers since he bought the first car. Mr Muffin was in a fraudulent community of Christians. He wanted to eat human, esp the strong and well muscled. He could not do that by himself. There were thousands of unarmed low price workers as refugees in lots of countries who are lonely, discriminated. They went to the community of Christians every Sunday to sing their little hope and their little gods. After that, men felt purified like Céstbon water and that’s the time they appeared most lovely and naïve and unarmed. They cooked the human in McDonald’s. Sometimes cooked with baby potatoes, baby chickens and lamb.

Mr Muffin just want the Welshman’s body. He only wanted him. In the past, he used to wake up on different beds with strangers or not whom he had had communicated fleshly. He ran a full body health check of the human he had sexual intercourse with. He sucked dicks of taxi drivers right in the cars. He slept with athletes and sport school male students. He even had sex with them in public toilets which are filthy, unresisted unhealthy and smelly, therefore unique and unforgettable. They liked him as he appeared to be foreign, pale, old and rich.

When spiders spin the cross on his wall upside down, he stopped sleeping with unrelated people and making connections physically. He was the old time good and faithful Christian. He hated gays. He stopped for years until the Welsh driver came into his life. Mr Muffin was from a well educated family. He was short, like to eat in Kungfu steamed food. He was lovely.

Being both gifted and cursed, he didn’t miss a second of bodily pleasure, never give up to volatilities and stupid governments, but, mais, he obeyed the rules of nature. He obeyed all the rules. He was a wizard traversing the tranquil crowds to fight ghosts that hurt humans. He was so strong and powerful that he must protect the human world from harms. He had an army of snakes, spiders, mice, wolves, man made humans.

While, at this moment, Mr Muffin was in the school, with a group of gay priests, thinking of the Welsh driver’s soft body all the time. Study was hard. Professor Muffin Tin was teaching in Kent and dating the French man. Mr Muffin was in debts from his last failed project of an underground city. Billy Yin was kind of enjoying failed projects in cities: it reminded him that he was living in the future. He saw the communist’s annual meeting room was in abundance in east Europe and he felt a sense of faded glory in the empty buildings once filled with smiling consumers and shops. As a spaceship falling from the sky and ran out of fuel forever, it reminded him of one thing lord Voldemort had said: only love lives forever.

Billy Yin was recently working in a space tourism site as a tech support assistant. Nothing was growing and they only had instant noodles, frozen food, packed reheated plane food, and bottled waters. He felt more tears in the waterless and soundless moon like dessert. His eyes damp itself. Sadness. He felt that most life forms came to the end.

He fell and had been sent to military hospitals. He thought about Tibet. Though he had been born as a Canadian, he had never experienced high altitudes, sunshine and timeless way of living. Tibet was not very far. If by car, he could arrive at Lesha in two days’ drive. He hadn’t had a car. His dad was a steady income government officer regulating local food safety. He never wanted a car as he had been in Shanghai relying on public transport for so long.

The team manager was an interesting 40 year old senior. He thought that Billy Yin had been so sick after his visit to South Africa and Chile. He noticed that. So when Billy Yin had both time and free medical care, he took him out by a Jeep, showed him the points of owing a car and a camera. I want to fly so I bought a car. He told Billy Yin. When Billy Yin joined the company he was thinking of buying a Ford. Now he rented a car anywhere he went by Henz.
Billy Yin was a lab test result and beta of Siemens and Chinese army’s special joint national security level project, he woke up in an all clean, cold and white lab with no sunlight. He could remember nothing. Until one day he found that he was not a creation of the nature. He thanked god deeply in his heart, if he still had one, that his mother gave birth to him.

Mother earth, though some human tried to be the mom. Billy Yin was so sick that he had been relying on breathing machine. His heart failed. The Chinese doctors couldn’t stop his internal bleeding in his stomach. He had blue blood, which he joked with his sister was because of drinking Pepsi too much. He would like to see birds, wild animals and all the other creatures. It made him feel the good of being alive.

He had no hope. He knew that he could never afford a private toilet in any part of the world. He always stayed in motels for business travelling. He got his small corner in Shanghai but he knew that big money won’t came to his riverside as there is no trading ships stopping in a place with no harbor. He paid his rents every first day of the month, and ate crisps of Layers and a box of apples his classmate sent to him from her lab. For one whole month, his machine part functioned badly. He could not eat anything.

He had no hope. Her sister was lying and lying on TV for the incompetence of local industries. His sister, logically in his brain. His sister, so why do I have no memory of my childhood wit such a female? His sister once said, men here are stupid and deaf, I have to cover for them like a hen for its baby chickens. After her marriage with the Swedish white man, Billy Yin understood perfectly some people don’t do as what they say.

Mr Muffin was invited by the military to treat Billy Yin who kept a high fever and flakey skin. His joints were all bruised, swelled with internal bleeding. His eyes were red. Mr Muffin was one of the secret doctors in several countries’ military, specializing in strange diseases and aliens. He had adopted by Ireland for 20 years and he had been a very double agent.

He sucked all of Billy Yin’s blood every night so every morning Billy Yin’s machine part had to run by itself rather that exploiting Billy Yin’s flesh. But only for a while, the doctor had to give the blood back. He remembered that it was not the first human who had been turned into a robot.

Mr Muffin took Billy Yin into his paper box. They landed in Chile where Billy Yin had been damaged. Billy Yin had not recovered. He found Mr Muffin good looking, charming and tender. He asked if he could have sex with him. Mr Muffin said I am too old for you. Billy Yin then got off the paper box, stepped into the nature with a windspeed that no camera could stand. Mr Muffin said: I am a rich tv guy. I had been making documentaries around the world and broadcasting them as a life long career. If you want to get rid of Siemens and the crazy Chinese role, to go back to you clergyman role, I could help.

Billy Yin said: is it real?

Mr Muffin picked up a stone, grained it in his palm. He then found a bird’s egg, cooked it in his palm. He caught a fish, transformed it into a flower. He said, no, it’s not real. He then hold the driver’s hand, telling Billy Yin that only the flesh you are holding is worth dying for. The Welshman’s hands were like a piece of silk flowing around Mr Muffin’s immortal cold. He could feel that Mr Muffin had wounds: long lost lover, mission impossible, stuck in the door of this world and the after life, and above all, the inability of smiling. It is not warm enough, so he became his driver.

It turned dark, everyone needs a home. They decided to go to a local police’s home where his wife and daughter had been preparing dinner for these cold miserable men working in the winds and sunshine all day. The soils were too dry for any plants to grow. Mr Muffin’s devil’s eyes were not like Billy Yin’s which were full of water and innocent. Billy Yin soon felt that two devils were around him and he was again a prisoner. Night had come and you could hear wolves in the wind. He wanted to escape. Mr Muffin said: one step outside the door and you will be eaten. Billy Yin suddenly missed his manager’s warm, relaxed Chinese jokes and his dream of buying a Ford instead of renting expensively around.

He felt wind, snow, rain and a time lapse of every growing things in Patagonia. He heard waves, seagull and breaking of eggs. Though his eyes had been plugged out as he could not control his lust for men any more, he did evil, thought evil. His eyes were in a glass of hot water, for purifying reasons. He smelt mint, toothpaste, double swords chewing gum, and trees. He took a sweet made of ginger containing a pine nut. It was from the wonderful cook Mr Muffin according to a very old recipe. Mr Muffin said, do you want a hot bath in my paper box? I could place it amidst the penguins. Billy Yin felt that he had been cured when he washed his skin: the machines were so steadily, silently, smoothly running.

### COVEL GREENWOOD – THE WHOLE STORY.

Money is not a problem.

Covel Greenwood was born in Xi’an. When he came back from Europe, his mother was killed. His father married a new wife. His father tried to kill him. He could not do it by himself. He sent Covel to his uncle, who was in the local army. The uncle didn’t kill Covel. He sent him to a remote region, heart of Chinese Communists’ struggle in 1940s.

A priest told Covel not to fight with the Japanese invaders, but to learn from them. Covel was young and inexperienced. He was with another soldier on a secret resistance stop near a mountain road. In the valley, it was green and even a river was running. They were not covered by any trees up on top of the mountain where were only sunshine and bushes.

It was hard. They had to carry water up onto the hill. It was silent. It was hot. Japanese cars came to check who was living in the small house. Covel said they two were gay men who had to escape to this wildness to survive. Covel could only sleep if he heard the other soldier’s breath. The Japanese were behaving badly. The other solder thought that they still might be killed just as a joke as gay men were a public joke even in Japanese’s eyes. He chose to sacrifice himself to spoil the Japanese’s joy of killing. He somehow made the officer angry and got himself killed. Facing weak Chinese is like a grade 4 harry potter watching freshmen passing. Why not to do some bullying? Killing for fun could only be stopped when there is no fun.

After that, Covel began to challenge Japanese in private occasions. On the second floor of a restaurant near the Goose pagoda, he thought about all the lost things once existed in this city, his hometown, then left to the Yellow river bank to fight with a Japanese one to one.

The fight ended with Americans’ intervention. Covel’s best friend who was sick in a Shanghai hospital asked the American rangers to help. Covel then had a chance to study in the US to be a doctor. His friend died sadly. He returned to Shanghai, had a nice hospital job. His father was affected by the war ongoing, hearing that his son had had a modern life, sent him a letter.

Covel ignored the letter. He then followed his teacher’s advice to leave China. He was in debts to a company who supported his study. He moved to Singapore and still worked for the company. He married to a movie director’s daughter there.

It is said that Covel was peacefully moving to Singapore. But, every story had another version. Covel was possibly travelling with a professional traveler and then arrived Malaysia. He became a craftsman making wooden things.

Seeing Billy Yin struggling with money, Professor Muffin Tin had to tell this war time story to him. Billy Yin was a Christian, which means he had to hide every time the government came to search local churches. BBC reported a government officer in Beijing invited the journalist to his home to see the alter. Billy Yin just wanted to hang a cross in the room and sing southern cross freely, not looking like an alien. While, when he found Chinese put a big slogan “this is a Christian family”, he found it fraudulent as it is too foreign and too frank for a Chinese under Communist education and rule for years.

Professor Muffin Tin never questioned himself with serious questions. God creates men and makes women give birth. Professor Muffin Tin also knew that women made men labor and bring back home money and good clothes. He had been a cook. He understood that thinking differently and behaving differently could be shouted and fired. He then never left school to keep himself in the front of techs and ideas as he felt that he was too old and he had been in a very disadvantaged, margined position.

“ok, ” he said in the telephone to Billy Yin, from Kent University to Shanghai, “you know it’s a communist country and there should be no money. So never worry about it as long as it is still a communist country.”

“What? But everything is charged and you just can’t say it’s people’s restaurant and I am one of the people and it should be free,” Billy Yin was counting the time as his phone would be charged when picking up international calls.

“I said, when you found that there had been no money pouring into your bank account for months, years, think like this: on the foundation of this country there should not be even a bank.”

“that’s rubbish.”

“Has Trump told you in his book that you should make use of money rather than checking pay cheque?”

“yes, a little, like Danish rolls and classic music: pay cheque is a fraud but writing stories is assets of one’s own. Good things never fade.”

“Has the government told you that the banks were once in big debts and had had lots of problems in China? Why are you using them still? ”

“I have a pay cheque and have to pay the rents and utilities.”

“How much money do you think is secure?”

“secure for what? ”

“to be a Christian and live as one.”

“I could only live once and I have to choose if there is no other option. If I were a Taiwanese and I were overaged I had to marry to any available option even it is from mainland.”

“that means you have no time left.”

“I think I need a business to make money rather than having the money. 1,000,000 rmb. Yes.”

“that’s just a car’s price.”

“just give me the money.”

### 18 SINGLE MUM WITH THREE JOBS.

The battle between the countries raged around Billy Yin’s small space mission base. A tractor was in the field miles away from the base’s heavy wall.

Billy Yin felt that he had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is, long time, lung disease feeling like something obstructed in the tunnel. After his three hours travel by the tube, he made his landfall at the automatic repetitive working place. He missed blue sky and sunshine again. In his eyes, the red and orange warm sunrise in Chile had been replayed again and again. The sun officially died and Neptune was spinning in the universe with Triton. There was only lamps on the cold planet. While, the space mission was a state project. Billy Yin fetched himself a yaourt aromtise a la vanille and some guimauves. He could imagine stars on their courses now light drawing on the forever night sphere. He was wearing a windcheater as it was still cold even in the building.

When Billy Yin was not an orphan, he had been well looked after. He didn’t had robot eyes. His parents loved him, sending him to pianos, this and that lessons. He remembered the scenes those didn’t belong to him. They were heartwarming, vivid comparing to the single room he had now.

Mr Muffin said to the Welshman, waving to Billy Yin’s back which disappeared into the dim lights: “Oh, I think I’m a false.”

“What?”

“That’s Boolean. I’m not a true, I’m a false.”

Welshman said: “Have those warts gone on your skin?”

Mr Muffin answered: “I can’t get affected by transmitted diseases, OK?”

Welshman said: “we both did that but it was only me who get dirty.”

Mr Muffin said: “Can’t resist them, you?”

Welshman said: “I fear you, Mr Muffin, you are not human. The young men were jovial and I was viscerally attracted by them.”

Mr Muffin said: “I fear for you, Mr W. I had bought this half robot from Siemens. It’s not a kid. I want a child. Not like this one.”

Welshman said, lighting a cigarette: “Adopt one?”

Mr Muffin said :” Could we turn him back to human? He still had a better half left.”

While Billy Yin was bracing the endless calculation and tests, the two men were talking about how to raise one kid like a human woman.

79 INT: DEL MR APARTMENT: RIVERTON: MORNING:

Dreary little apartment. Peeling wallpaper. Faint sound of washing machines coming from below.

ALMA, baby FRANCINE on her hip, coffee cup in the other hand. Watches from a window, as ENNIS tries to stat his pickup. It coughs, sputters, finally catches. ALMA sets the coffee cup down on the window still—waves—but ENNIS doesn’t see her, and drives off, dust swirling on the pavement.

Another pickup pulls up in front of the house just after ENNIS leaves. The town grocer, MONROE, a chubby little man in a grocer’s apron and cap, steps out of the truck and carries three bags of groceries to the front door.

ALMA opens the door and greets him.

Though shy, he’s obviously thrilled to see her.

MONROE

(blushes)

Mornin’, Alma.

(smile)

Where would you like ‘em?

ALMA, though pleased, is surprised by this gesture.

ALMA

(points)

Set ‘em there on the table.

(pause)

I told you, Monroe, you don’t got to do this.

MONROE steps inside and sets the groceries on the cluttered table.

MONROE

(looks adoringly at ALMA)

I got a few bags going over to Mrs. Fry’s. She busted her hip. You’re right on the way.

(smiles)

ALMA kikes MONROE’s good nature. Sets FRANCINE down and gets het purse from the counter. FRANCINE immediately toddles out of the room.

ALMA

Sure do appreciate it. What do I owe you?

MONROE pulls the receipt out of his pocket and looks at it.

MONROE

Eight dollars and seventeen cents.

ALMA hands a five-dollar bill to MONROE, then scrapes the bottom of her purse for change. She comes up with another two dollars in quarters. Hands them to MONROE.

ALMA

(embarrassed)

I still owe you a dollar and some change.

(looking around the messy kitchen)

I swear, I had some change in a cup somewhere….

MONROE

Don’t you worry about it, Alma.

ALMA

(blushes)

Why… than you, Monroe. I’ll have it next time, then.

MONROE

(smiles)

Next time, then.

MONROE tips hat to ALMA, walks to the door and exits.

95 INT: GROCERY STORE: WYOMING: EARLY EVENING:

ALMA, a little older and a little less skinny, though still just as cute, is clerking at the grocery store. As she rings up groceries, WE SEE MONROE, now a manager, wearing a cheap tie, flirting, smiling at her. ALMA smiles back.

The customer leaves. ALMA and MONROE are alone. MONROE opens a box of Junior Nints and eats one.

ALMA

What are you smilin’ ’bout?

MONROE

(chewing, smiles even wider)

Nothin’.

ALMA

Gotta be somethin’.

MONROE

Just happy, I guess.

MONROE throws a Junior Mint at Alma.

ALMA

(laughing)

Stop that!

Just then, ENNIS walks into the store. MONROE and ALMA immediately stop their flirting.

ENNIS walks up to ALMA’s counter. MONROE hurries back to the office, afraid of ENNIS.

ENNIS

(pointing to the cigarettes behind the counter)

Two packs.

ALMA

(not getting the cigarettes)

Who’s watchin’ the girls?

ENIIS

They’re outside in the truck.

ALMA

(darkens)

I coulda brought home your smokes. ‘Sides, it’s way past their bedtime.

ENNIS

(grim)

They quicker you give me the damn smokes, the quicker they’ll be home in bed.

112 INT: MONROE HOUSEHOLD: THANKSGIVING NIGHT: KITCHEN:

ENNIS had gallantly brought a dinner plate or two into the kitchen, set s them on the counter.

Leans against the counter. ALMA is scraping food off the dinner plates.

ALMA

(trying to start conversation)

You ought to get married again, Ennis.

(pause)

Me and the girls worry ‘ about you bein’ alone so much.

ENNIS

(feeling too big for the room)

Once burned….

ALMA

(scraping)

You still go fishin’ with Jack Twists?

ENNIS

Some.

A beat.

ALMA

You know….

From her tone, ENNIS knows something is coming.

ALMA (cont’d)

(trembling, but controlled)

… I used to wonder how come you never brought any trouts home. Always said you got plenty, you know how me and the girls like fish.

(pause)

So one time I got your creel case open the night before you went on one a your little trips—price tag still on it after five years—and I tied a note on the end of the line. It said, ‘Hello, Ennis, bring some fish home, love, Alma’…

(pause)

…And then you come back lookin’ all perky and said you’d caught a bunch a browns and ate them up.

Looks over at ENNIS, a stiff smile on her face.

ALMA (cont’d)

Remember?

ENNIS doesn’t answer.

ALMA is scraping harder and faster, as if she means to take the pattern off the plates.

ALMA

I looked in the case first chance I got and there was my note still tied there.

(looks at him now)

That line hadn’t touched water in its life.

ALMA turns on the water in the sink, sluices the plates.

ENNIS

That don’t mean nothin’.

ALMA

(turns on him)

Don’t lie, don’t try to fool me no more, Ennis. I know what it means. Jack Twist? Jack Nasty. You and him….

ENNIS grabs her wrist and twists it.

Tears spring to her eyes, she drops a dish.

ENNIS

Shut up. Mind your own business. You don’t know nothin’ about it.

ALMA

I’m goin’ a yell for Monroe.

Winds were blowing in the ice dessert and two long shadows were smoking and cooking in front of the paper box. Rain dropped a little. Then stars came out again quickly. When the sun broke into pieces, everyone in the polar system had prepared. Noodles done, and wasabi semi-gel with wild herbs (winter springs) done after four hours. Billy Yin ended his shift, took a rest while waiting the computer to react, thinking about mum, Mary and the child, a sign of too tired. So little, so small, so short as a random particle, he was very lucky to be near two middle aged men, who had a house and visas to travel around the world. He knew that they were enjoying themselves outside the wall and he was enjoying his lab job in the unaffected pure white futuristic building. And they were pervert and he was the last hope to find the next sun.

### TALK ABOUT FIRE EXIT.
Professor Muffin Tin finished his ASDA whole fat milk, with a thought that vegetarian and not vegetarian have no much difference: just switched from meat to non meat source of protein. He thanked ASDA as in Tesco he found things were limited and expensive. From the third world, he had to be careful with money as he knew in this old world the rich had their own reasons to be rich. In brief, he admitted he had been put into a disadvantage in this, if you call it one, life of competition.

Kent was nice. Teaching foreign students after years of serving the international company, Professor Muffin Tin, dressed in the most shinning way, was trying his best to teach as many students as he could. The school hadn’t put his nationality on his profile page so lots of students thought he was in exchange programme as a visiting teacher. The truth was he hadn’t been living in China for years.

Kent was nice. Kent police Mr Johnson Norwich noticed the strangely dressed old Asian man with white hair and his circles of friends. One day when Mr Johnson pushed another post of newly prisoned criminals’ information online, a customized tweet showed up in the feed. It was a piece od news by the BBC about a Chinese lady in Shanghai who murdered her British husband after years of marriage and two kids. Then there was a link in the “Read more”: Chinese woman burnt in a flat with questions raised by local media. Mr Johnson was trying in Word, with ahis mouse clicking and scrolling in the browser on another screen connected to the internet. “Paper bitch,” his colleague passed by, mocking him. The picture showed a flat on fire and after Mr Johnson clicked in, a photo of Professor Muffin Tin showed up, with the caption “The dead woman among the 74 dead has a husband who had gone abroad suspiciously since the accident.” Mr Johnson searched the database of foreigners, noticing htat this Chinese man was of Swedish nationality. He then forgot the news, pasted the tweet in the official account with infos of an old man forcing a young boy into a sexual relationship then ending up with 18 years in prison. Mr Johnson knew Kent’s street like his palm.

Professor Muffin Tin’s publications were mainly between his 50s and 70s. In his long, long lists of rewards, public events, books and articles, there had been no flaw after all the citations and questions. Normal researchers pushed buttons; Professor Muffin Tin always used hidden features in the machines with scripts. He understood the equipment well and sometimes made them.

One late dark evening after replying all the letters from students, Professor Muffin Tin went out of the building to get into his car. He saw through all the parts behind the metal shell of the machine, confirmed no harms had been made to it, then opened the door, put himself into the seat. The bell rang in the building at the moment. Glasses were cracked; fire swallowed the research center. Again, he woke up in a McDonald’s with a cup of coffee in his right hand and a cigarette in another. He watched his wife of years from poverty to wealth and respect burning and smokes rising into Shanghai’s blue sky. He packed things and boarded onto a plane.

“Sir, are you ok?”

“You’re in St Jimmy Hospital. I’m the nurse.”

Finally sick on bed, Professor Muffin Tin thought, I could take a rest.

He had been diagnosed with several sexual transmitted diseases when he had oral, anis and virginal sex with strangers. After he discovered internet, he gave up the crush on straight colleagues and students, went directly into immoral relationships outside his marriage. In his mouth, shaft of the penis, tips of the penis and anus, there had been bumps like a skin disease. He had school hospitals and benefits to cover the treatment for free most of the time. But for the sex partners it was not that lucky. One of them was told to have AIDS when he wanted to donate, sell blood to buy a camera. They tried group sex like team work, very ugly, very exiting and no one wanted to sleep. Blood were shed. Some cried.

Professor Muffin Tin could make fake gold in his lab. He called them the tears of his past. There had been no law regulating them. Three days without sex, he felt his teeth on fire. His mouth had been burnt by hot food. There was no solution to his needs. He slept in the lab in school with fans and air conditioning. He was well protected and didn’t want tot go back to the crowded you-know-me I-know-you flat of colleagues. In the big lab, he felt safe and cool to be himself, to master the machines, gravity, forces, and sometime to rub himself while waiting for the results. He cried, laughed, dealt with all the time alone unnoticed, in lack of food, drink, clothes, love, care, anything. He cried to make his eyes feel better. He cried with a bottle of Coca-Cola that made him drunk. He felt drunk with any drinks. He kicked the can to the corner of the room, then try to cry louder in the 3 am big white glassed lab. He felt sad as he had no friend. His tears filled a flask, filled a container, filled a swimming pool. Then the whole school got flooded by his tears. He said: “Oh, my dear wife, the only dearest person in the world, I had no one outside our marriage. But I had to end your life as I had adopted a blood drinking son. Blood drinking, yes, flocks of birds in the morning, coming irresistibly. How could I kill my little sweet dream? How could I stop the image around me for years with a knife? I had been in the darkness and I would be jealous if you had a long life. I had to eat you.”

He had been treated badly in supermarkets outside school. Sometimes a researcher could be fragile and exposed to har, if he was not in a school or powerful company. He used fire in the war. He was like a sun burning. Yet, he had to sweat. He had to labor. He had to get up at ten in the evening and serve till nine in the night. His sweats became salt. He felt a pinch of them dropping into his eyes. His closed one eye. Diving into his memory, he remembered that once he was to pick up an office from a famous Japanese camera company who helped the lenses in the spaceship. The airport was hot and the when the Japanese came, he was like had been caught in the rain. At the airport, the plane had been delayed for three hours. Professor Muffin Tin felt that in research, when uncertainty beat certainty and god’s almighty can’t be explained, it was the weakest point when waves were stirred by known forces. Bring human, with the intelligence as the only light occasionally appearing during a storm, he needed a windcheater, something made of high tech materials to be waterproof and warm. The Japanese arrived with luggages and a bag on his back, suit of course. In 1995, Mr Muffin Tin bought his first green windcheater from a brand as a gift for himself and the cloth to visit America, where he later realized that he need a car to escape from severe weather. Cod controlled the wind and air. When he was not happy, he set fires and brought hailstorms. Professor Muffin Tin stayed in his car, with Monica Lin in a light blue windcheater in the back seat who had been pregnant, watching hails dropping down to hit the guys without preparation or prediction or weather forecasting. Now, he stayed on his sick bed, with flowers from the small community of “refugees” from China: the corrupted businessman and the teacher to restaurant owner, watching the bulbs jumping up and down in the young nurse’s tight small size uniform, finding that the bigger the better doesn’t fit for his feeling towards women.

Soaked in red wine, he felt the French young man was sweet and making him fall and drunk. His every word was a signal for the old man to take off his trousers by force. The old man was like wind, the force of changing. Who could grab his free heart? It reminded him of all the Shanghainese boys he wanted to sleep with.
