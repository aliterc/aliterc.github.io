_I am a senior media company manager working for Wong Yong and Zhu Chen magazine. After graduated from Cardiff University with a failed dissertation talking about frauds endlessly, lacking journalistic skills, I got an offer from Vancouver Film School for film production. I read The Guardian film reviews. I have applied for NYU Tisch school twice. I don't read entertainment news. I know a little about lightning and sculpting. Dr Richard Clayton from Cambridge Univeristy once gave me an [interview](https://allenneptune.wordpress.com/2018/05/03/appendices/). I had shortly stayed in print shops and then wanted to make my own weekly online channel SEV7ENPLUS. After that, I shot photos and shared them online COVELNEPTUNE with a moving workstation. I found that I hardly know any Americans though film making really needs Americans._

### 怎样画TIN TIN
Posted by allenneptune on 01/05/2018

我很小的时候，其实想做个画家。

后来我越来越远了。现在基本不愿意画画。

但是我的确很感兴趣丁丁历险记是怎么画的。作者是个很严肃的catholic，连上班都是在catholic的报纸。刚开始是写东西，后来就开始画漫画在报纸上连载。我发现想出书很多人都在出版行业工作，也许我应该试试。我觉得旅行是件很危险的事 （the bbc’s xxx was shot dead)，尤其是想旅行到世界的每个角落，一定是充满“历险“的。

我前几天发现一件事，丁丁应该是个考古学家，而不是记者。记者只是记录，不去想解决问题，更不会去和谁作对。

据我对漫画作者的研究，画这个漫画的工艺还是蛮复杂的。首先起线稿，线稿是很草的，不像林莹老师的线稿那么纤细，没有多余的线，这个比利时人不是专业的画画科班出身的，是自学成才的，草稿改得基本看不成。然后据我看过一个俄国插画家画画的过程，要用红蓝铅笔改，再在更大的纸上再画一遍，纸再撑在一个木框上，便于水彩上色，最后用彩铅修饰。我不太明白用什么样的纸清理草稿，因为那时没有Photoshop没法调透明度蒙着勾线。先出版的是黑白的钢笔稿，有贴图。出版之后几年再出的彩色版。我还是不明白没有Photoshop怎么把颜色加在原来的黑白线稿下面，而且可以上色上得如此均匀。

中国画的工笔画其实上色也很均匀，我不是很明白宣纸上或者丝绢上怎么颜色不会晕开。

说丁丁历险记的画家开创了一种叫“清晰的线“的绘画风格，即人物没有阴影，颜色鲜明等。

据我推测，作者的背景画得极其像照片，尽管是寥寥几笔，不像日本风格的漫画中背景那么细致地画照片，也不想美国风格中那样细致地画背景，但从背景到人物都符合现实世界中的比例，看的时候感觉作者是的确去过这些地方的。尤其是很多跨文化的地方，作者完全是在找着照片描嘛。

拿南美洲为例，丁丁系列有两个故事都是在南美发生。我看到一个秘鲁的纪录片，有一个历史遗迹就是丁丁那一本旧版的封面。林莹老师在画魔尘的时候，去西藏旅行了，我对西藏的印象完全是被林老师消化过又创作出来的，我记忆很深林老师很精细的人物服装，佛庙装饰和风雪天。

宫崎骏的工作室经常去欧洲写生。

以上只讨论一个漫画系列的地点环境服装设定，关于人物的绘画，日本漫画有自己的方法，美国漫画全是费墨的肌肉男和阴影，丁丁系列就是很省墨，人物动作完全不走形很准确。作者的分镜头不像美日漫画那样乱搞—怎么会有那么奇形怪状的摄像机取景框—基本是一张纸从上到下四个column，没有斜的分镜，都是长方形正方形的，如果占用一个分镜占用一个column以上，一定是整个两个column，绝对不会出现竖着的分割（我有点语言表达不了了）。

2d动画也是画的。在B站上看到一个樱桃小丸子的工作室参观，讲如果是电影的话，剧本就要写七八个月。动画一秒七帧，原来是用透明的塑料板上画的，背景和动画都是手绘，叠在一起用一个向下的相机照。现在背景我们能看到还是手绘的，动画都用电脑画了。李安导演的中场休息说一秒120帧，很适合慢速嘛。再看迪士尼的手绘长篇，真有耐心啊。

我觉得画画是件很旧世界的事情，我自己是个依赖新科技的人，画画这种古老的艺术形式比起摄影来讲不很适合我，即使在电脑上画。我有点怀疑视效是不是适合我了，因为在视效的背后是很传统的艺术训练，是很古老的事情。

我在做照相，录像和写文章，做网站的成套出国旅行指南。恺撒旅游好像有把自己的卡通形象称为恺恺撒撒，就像静静安安，火车上的健健康康一样。我想做个 跟燕姿和仓木麻衣 游世界，因为新加坡和日本的护照旅行太好用了。

我去过的地方很少。小时候跟着父母旅行团，上中学基本不出西安市。大学时候跟着学生社团考试找工作去了一些地方。

我集中旅行实在12-13年，每周末我都要出去逛一下。

签证，由于我们国家的护照很不好用，艾未未还是陈丹青老师很早就放弃大陆护照了，应该是后者吧，办好了台湾护照后还去问使馆这个大陆护照能不能退还了。但是网络著名旅人在换加拿大护照之前还是用中国护照环游了世界，说明不要怪政府，要怪怪自己不用心，抱怨的人脸都不好看。

我去年把自己护照扔了，上面盖了两个国家的签证页。旅行的时候都要用护照开房，落地签时上飞机去的时候就很慌，边检似乎很明白签证政策还是懒，没记得盘问我，下飞机去落地签，感觉有点小贵，坐了巴士进城找不到宾馆，远的地方自己不会开车，没敢乱跑，第二天就坐飞机回了，其实订票的时候好像就订的是隔天的返程票，只在异国待了一天，主要是一个人也没计划好，一群人就敢多待几天的。

我觉得会开车会游泳是很关键的环球旅行本领。到一个地方乘公交来来回回很傻逼，不如到了就租个车，当然公交还是要熟悉因为搞不好就要乘公交的。游泳当然是为了自救。

文化冲突会很严重吧，没事就不要去不是旅游区的地方了。

中国少了一味药 是一部描绘社会问题的书。

抛弃作者要探讨的主题，其中的描写了四件社会问题：

无家可归
穿黑巷，众入黑屋。大房，里面几个卧室。大房沙发，郝金肖庞坐上吱吱作响，无明炷，味劣，鼾声四起。 

2. 家庭问题

3. 犯罪

打人就是招新人做你的赚钱机器，让你收回成本，坐收从他销量和招人中的你的那一份。分三步：市场列表，引人，迎接。 

4. 疾病

传说中前美国驻华大使就是因为这样的压力才辞职的。因为很像中国的外籍国内问题大臣。

我以前是摄影爱好者。一遇到社会问题有相机的都喜欢用黑白表现，什么绿车皮的人挤人站票难熬的三天三夜啊，什么拆迁啊，什么乞讨啊，总之触目惊心。如果是专业的摄影记者，机器好一点，报纸上印黑白也比较吓人，所以彩色照片看着但是内容一个比一个更吓人。

看过 贫民窟的百万富翁，感觉其实也都正常，没什么大不了的。

我最近觉得好像对这本小说的改编有点思路了。

From book to film
23
by :
ReganS

Like many people, I get an initial feeling of dread when I hear that a book I like has been turned into a film. Sometimes I won’t even watch the film even though I love the story! This is a sentiment shared by many and for good reasons too. Here are, what I believe to be, the main problems with films adapted from books.

Firstly, the characters are NEVER as you imagined them. Even if a novel provides a clear physical description and detailed analysis of all of their quirks and characteristics, the character is always different. It can also be difficult when a well-known celebrity is playing the role as it is hard to separate the real-person and the character.

Secondly, if a novel is long or filled with lots of action and events it is generally impossible to condense it down into a two hour long film without cutting parts out. Of course, nowadays it has become common to split a novel into two parts, making two films. However, if there is an event in the novel that does not necessarily progress the narrative and is not something that will appeal to the majority of the audience, then it is likely to be cut from the story completely.

Thirdly, filmmakers like to use a bit of artistic license, and can sometimes change a storyline completely. This can be to suit the audience the film is being aimed at or just because they feel their interpretation is more appropriate.

Finally, a film is just one interpretation of a novel. If a novel has been read by a million people then that means there are a million versions of that novel floating around in people’s minds. Therefore it is extremely improbable that the filmmaker has the same interpretation as you, or the other 999,999 readers.

It can be annoying watching a film that completely changes a story you like. The recent, award-winning film, Silver Linings Playbook, for example, was based on a book I love. It was changed an awful lot from the book, with various characters and events completely altered. However, despite being incredibly different, it maintained the same positive, feel-good mood of the book, making it really enjoyable. Do not be deterred from watching an adaptation, just because it might be different does not mean that you will definitely not enjoy it.

贾柯樟的电影描述社会问题。玉观音也在写社会问题。能解决社会问题的非官即神。

我们只是关心一下。

成人世界和儿童世界不同，是因为成人世界鲜血淋漓的。以前一直在拍城市，城市的city line， 城市的glory，城市精致的商店，花朵，夜里醉酒胡闹的人群。

最早有一个三星的手机，不能拍照没有存储卡。很薄。后来在买电脑的公交车上丢了。是我爸给我买的。

之后买了一个诺基亚的导航手机，据说相机是蔡司的头，导航地图很强大，很windows phone一样，概念很棒。现在那个app的概念也是那个手机就有的。手机的下落不明。

之后接触了摄影，第一个是在京东上吧，分期的佳能入门级相机，不是东京进口的。画面很漂亮，比尼康的柔。拍摄了汤机场，青海支教，慕田峪长城。大二买的，大三卖掉了。感觉这些电子设备一入手就二手价了。当时修图修得很重，其实原图就很漂亮了。

后来一阵没有相机，就在豆瓣上淘了一个二手的胶片机。做地铁到北京城里什么地方，对方以为我是个年龄很大的玩家。价钱是900块。这个相机拍了毕业季的情况，还有宁波的拆迁，基督教堂，还有生活小景，很适合带在口袋里有感觉了捏一张。冲洗的时候已经三卷了，宁波有冲洗的地方，卡迪夫也有，洗出来如果对焦准确还是很漂亮的。绿色调日本风。

大四元旦买了一个尼康的相机，一万块。但是这个机器后来用于拍摄视频很多。出门拍街上的人用它，出门游玩用它，拍摄美食用它，明显感觉有点大。但是当时身边有很多专业级大相机。

研一买了苹果的机器，平板，macbook和手机都有，就不怎么用第二个诺基亚手机，我爸买给我的，当时还蛮喜欢的因为龙云在用。摄影工作室的孩子挺富的，我原来穿的都是杂牌经常去动物园西单，现在不得不买苹果的itouch和牌子货。

研一的还买了一个当时Thomas Lethaud和老刘忙都在用的松下微单，很好用很舒服很像个女朋友。在人面前捏一张声音基本听不到，又不会抖，颜色对焦都很准。问题一点是视频格式有点诡异。这个相机一般是上街乱捏用的。我那时挺有钱乱跑的，但是很多地方到了都不拍照。有点自私不发照片。图虫也删光了。后来又入了三脚架，相机包，快门线，小dv。我采访的时候也用这个拍，有点不对，应该带三脚架打灯的。但是这样可能拍着人们没有压力。

我在证件照婚礼记录店打过工，会拍证件照，可是到了英国进了证件照店人家说要培训我很久不愿用我。

后来有一阵没有智能手机用，买不起，回国买了中关村买了一个5000块的港行水货三星，晨星同款，伦敦奥运会那阵很火的带手写笔的。后来又买了一个三星的手机，后来又买了一个三星的手机，都挺烂的。

我以前用新传的机器拍得手抖，又不会拍视频，还天天剪。到现在还是不会拍。

拍摄社会问题的时候会遇到阻拦，不论是官方的，还是被拍摄方。我问过媒体法的老师街上能不能乱拍，老师讲街上的都可以拍。实际上如果是自己拍的话，比较困难，如果是卧底暗访的话，自己做更困难了。

慕容雪村先生在我留学的时候还去英国了一次。他是比较有背景的，所以可以这样卧底。

我感觉他是有一对摄影记者的眼睛的。是那种很严肃的新闻摄影记者，不是官媒拍开会飘红旗一片花海粉红色气球的。

当然他非官非神，所以他只好记录下了。当你凝视深渊时，深渊会拉你下去。

The lost happiness (China) 200 RMB day return 5h Taipei_Gaoxiong

Life is a swirl. Once we admit this, half of the miseries in it have been explained. Life is a swirl, which means if you don’t work harder, you will be dragged down to the heart of the ocean automatically.

I heard this saying in the movie Duets (2000), which had bad reviews. So, these movies mislead audience.

Happiness is saving money. When you got a bargain and get the cheapest of the same quality, you must feel happy.

Maybe it is because I got into that I have been always unhappy. I’m sick and I can’t feel very happy. I force myself into a smile and it is hard.

Happiness is you end the long years of saving money and finally buy a house in full payment. You feel fine. You feel secure.

Happiness is the nightclub with a karaoke and loud music every night finally go away from your neighborhood.

Happiness is when we don’t need to care about anything, no string attached. When we got nothing to concern, we are free. Some may say this is irresponsible. That’s because irresponsible fathers in the UK abandoned their children and wives. They have to care for them. For me, I got nothing, even don’t have shelter for the night. I don’t have to care for anyone. I’m free. I’m happy.

If a Welsh could regain their ancestors’ land, they would be happy.

If a gay man could sleep with whoever he wants, he would be happy.

If a film maker could earn a single award in major festivals, he should be happy.

But sometimes we see people crying on train back to Wales, gay man in Russia got beaten on street, director with limited means showed his pocessions to the public.

I call it the pitch, the highest and lowest in a tone. If we only pick the best moments in our life, the dish must be very expensive. So during normal days, we store the best for festivals and guests, just eat plain white bread.

Karl Max said London’s white bread were full of steel’s taste. I have experienced that. While, in China, in Familymart, white bread slices were full of sweet milk flavour. And the flavour was a little too much.

We have all kinds of unhappiness. But for sure, when sales goes up, moneys come in, efforts get paid, needs are fulfilled, no war, no disease, no pollution, no crime, everyone got happier except those who are not nice guys.

We truly have enemies.

Wales got lots of medical tourists using fake EU cards to exploit the benefits, I heard it on news. Sucking dicks, sodomy, all ways of gay sex are dangerous. Have your mum ever told you not to eat human waste? Movies, by their size of images, are not cheap. It’s absolutely a matter of money.

When we got hurt, is there a way to be healed? Yes, beat them. They dragged us down to the lowest, we must get rid of them to go back to normal.

Write a song of your life, you will find that in order to make it popular, it should remain simple and not that much up and down. Only when you want to go academic you challenge the highest and lowest, which gives you time to be alone and cut in influence. These are places where we could lose or win the battles in the war with our enemies.

Triumphs are short moments. We may feel born loser, if we always stare at those peaks.

Four o’clock in the morning. A baozi shop like Greggs in the UK, began its working day. I applied for Greggs once and I liked the sausage rolls. The owner might be sleeping on the second floor of the shop at a corner of a road cross. After having layered ten bamboo made 60cm qb containers with raw, flour and yeast made baozi, she opened the switcher of the boiler under the containers. A bored looking man walked closer to ask if the baozi were ready to eat. About 25 more containers of flour made food were waiting there to be steamed and sold. Small business like this are filling empty shops under commercial and home use buildings. They, the buildings are like a wardrobe for clean cloths. If I were a giant, I needed something, I might open these drawers, and surprisingly found small people were living in them. But finding something in so many drawers won’t be easy.

This crowded, filled with people situation made you feel small. The baozi shop had a mixer; so they don’t knead doughs by hand. The fillings might be in a fridge. A worker was putting fillings into baozi skins every 30 seconds.

It was five o’clock in the morning. Cities’ day starts at four o’clock. Sky became brighter, from dark grey to light dark blue. It was quite comfortable, cool, talking with people, doing business, down there in the baozi shop, compared with staying in an over-used, dirty, hot, bad air, toilet like cheap hostel room all day long. But, being in hotel rooms is nearer to the homes upstairs.
Soft, hot, full of air, skin not too thick not too thin, white baozi were ready to eat.

The city was smelly, hot. People love it. They couldn’t find the right employees, the right girls or boys; so they put ad out of their windows to find the right small fish in the ocean.

Giant like me found it hard to look for anything in these wardrobes.

Six o’clock in the morning. Already buses had been filled with people. Cars still not started. No dogs, no camera, no smoking, no…were signed outside McDonald’s. H&M was shinning last night. Starbucks not opened yet. Pizza hut not opened yet. Kentucky Fried Chicken prepared 17 porridges and 24 soybean milks for its early opening. Hubs of shopping food and cloths, transport could be expensive. A young man behaved like in the ad, pushed the restaurant’s door. Waves of new dishes came out. Cars for sale at the airport waiting hall. Walmart had about 200 employees per shop while the fried chicken shop had about 20. They provided low skill, minimum wage jobs to the right people. Tiny shops could turn to extremely huge in China: everyone said there were gold here. Walmart’s chicken had been deep-fried, buns had been steamed and even, cooled. Well- facilitated kitchens in Walmart had everything that could be turned to food. And they were clean, extremely.

Vegetables had been washed and sent to cities, with other goods arriving too.

Cities were heavy, metal made, harmful, expensive and friendly in a way.

“I hate summer,” when it was 6:30, kids went to school, one of them said. I used to kind of like it. Considering all the sweat I have shed in summer for baking, bottled water and Zbrush, I hate it, too. Kid, I agree with you.

Finally, I realized there was a wine shop. It sold plum wine once The times was using as a gift. I lusted for its manager who looked like steward in Crouching and hidden. Time, give it time. It solved every shit things of my readership.

That was the exit.

Seven o’clock in the morning,  I boarded on a train from Bristol to London. It was 80 GBP. I thought I might need another week or two in London. The trains ran for two hours. Then I switched to the tube. In the morning, young miserable look thin man was cleaning windows of coffee shop in the winter. The landlord escorted me to the ATM machine. Then I quitted the idea of renting their house.

Eight o’clock, young chefs had their lazy breakfast, young students in school had their late breakfast, then rushed to classrooms for the fucking sleepy math class.

Nine o’clock in the morning, a job interview began. Ok, I left home at six.

Ten o’clock in the morning, morning shows stop. Restaurants began to prepare for the lunch. It could be very busy. Chinese chefs need to pre cook everything needed so they could shorten the time for every dish. Guys who had been on night switch should be feeling sleepy now.

Eleven o’clock. High school’s third class in the morning nearly ended. While, in university in China, it means lunch time started.

Twelve o’clock. Staff on trains began to sell over-priced food. They would say “which customer needs food? which customer needs food?” as if it was not lunch time.

One o’clock in the afternoon. It could be very hot on streets. Sweating.  Drops of water from air conditioners. Hot. Hot. You won’t think to buy a hot baozi now.

Two o’clock in the afternoon. Sara began her long sleepy lectures. Hidden behind monitors, sitting at a corner of a newsroom, I had to record everything she said.

Three o’clock in the afternoon. It could be not that hot. Everyone was thinking, hey, two hours to go.

Four o’clock in the afternoon. After a day of boring standing there, our wine shop finally began to have customers. Ten to nine.  Lots of people rushed to banks before their closure.

Five o’clock in the afternoon. Traffic.

Six o’clock in the afternoon. Teachers asked students’ parents to come to school to have a chat on some problems. Some students were still sweeping the classrooms. Night was approaching.

Seven o’clock in the afternoon. Classic China Central TV News.

Eight o’clock in the evening. TV drama. Kids crying. Washing machine.

Nine o’clock in the evening. People in service began to hate customers.

Ten o’clock in the evening. Night clubs began. Drinks, shouting.

Eleven o’clock in the evening. At the end of the day. Counting. Counting the money in your purse.

Twelve o’clock in the evening. Always began to forget to look at the watch… already passed midnight.

One. You could breathe.

Two. You could be unconscious and careless in the dream.

Three. You could fall, cry, laugh, mock, wash away all the masks. And another day of laboring and pushed, dragged, mentored… came.
And, some guys never slept during nights.

The good

This is a lesbian story.

When we went to grade seven, books began to have fewer pictures and they were in black and white. This story is meant to give grade seven to grade nine students a lesson to tell them what lesbian is.

Susan Perkin is a lesbian. She lives with her girlfriend who is a nurse in a health check center. Susan Perkin is owner of a coffee shop and a photo studio.

One day she found herself got cancer. She had to shave herself bold to get the treatment. Her girlfriend is boyish and has many boys like her. She is straight, rude, short, black skin and beautiful. Her hair just reaches her shoulder.

Susan Perkin is also short. Her hair was cut short. She was awarded with several photo contest prize. A can of Coke is twenty in her coffee shop, which means the carefully arranged decoration (a bike on the wall), the clean and no smell toilets, the space, the facilities are stylish.

A couple of gay men wanted to open a bar nearby in this district near the Big tower where Chinese used to store books from India back to 700 AD. While, as my friend Joe moved into this district, I don’t think home owners would like to pay a visit to beer drinking and gay men dancing.

I was in a wine store for a day. Rich guys with oil money opened the shop for tea and wine. They played majiang and smoked all day long. Lots of meat with bones could be found in staff meal. They even had a chef and a very big stove. Only three staff shared a big bowl of meat— and one of them was a female saying she was intending to not eat, the other two were hungry college graduates.

I like rich guys. They make life brighter with their fancy four by fours and Gucci purses.

Summer is not hot to death. It was sunshine everywhere. Girls made their lips so red. When you look it twice, everything is a lie. Hidden behind food and clothing is called not suitable to be viewed. Shops close down quickly. Girls are ugly.

Just finished her travel to Japan, Susan Perkin received a resignation letter. Big Mac was shining in cold cold air conditioning but clients were not that many as it supposed to be to meet the rent.

I know you guys may rub yourselves at this early age. You may find sexual intercourse attractive and exciting. Men donate sperm into women’s worm then they got you guys. Sometimes, they do this not for making children purpose. So, that’s why same sex guys could have sex.

Doctors in the health check center see penises and genitals every day. They give them a quick look, then make a stamp on the paper to show pass or not.

Susan Perkin and her girlfriend were living in a neighborhood where gay men were singing together. They were in the club. Pretending to be someone’s wife is not a secret. When one man needs to get married to pass the thirty years old age when everyone elder wants you to be married, a lesbian could be found.

People in service are fucking hot in this district. People with best looking just pour in. Susan has married to a gay doctor, and her girlfriend has married to a gay seller. Things became complicated. By law, they could share properties and when divorce come, they should separate properties unless the marriage certificates are fake too.

Susan Perkin was dying. Cancer is curable but she died quickly. Then the shop was left to her girlfriend who had been relaxed, used to chatting all day long in the shit job. She quitted her job in the health center, focused on the café and photo business which she barely knew of.

The gay seller was an alcoholic addicted and bio sexual, once raped the slim girl. He was strong and big. She sang a lot. A lesbian from Singapore wanted to sleep with her and take her to Singapore. She refused.

Every night at twelve, Susan Perkin would appear. People say if the dead had something they miss very much, or things they could not forget, they would show up in the old house. Susan Perkin wanted to punish a girl who told her parents that she was a lesbian, which led directly to her separation with her parents.

That girl was the one in my one day wine shop experience, who said she didn’t want to eat.

Just 200 meters, the wine shop and the coffee shop had two guys who never see eye to eye.

Susan Perkin’s girlfriend attacked the wine shop girl one night. They were fighting each other using their teeth and nails. The gay doctor was returning home. Seeing this scene, he stopped them. Then they made a deal, transformed the coffee shop into a bar, the two professional sellers shoot off every day to get customers for the studio. They lived happy after forever.

Lesbian is les bian, which means the good.

### EAT, DRINK, MAN, WOMAN 1994 REVIEW

Eat, drink, man, woman 1994 Review

I am not really a big fan of pop singers. For writing’s purpose and to grab the end of my youth, I chose to claim I had been a fan of three silly girls. As age grows, I felt old and father like, esp. towards young women. And I might be the fan of the young girls, spoiling them and with no sensible thoughts just because they are the youngest.

It’s about friendship and three layers of voices. Though woman always don’t have true female friends after marriage, women are always helping themselves in their own ways of socializing and empowering. I don’t think I could manage woman’s stories as these male Chinese directors did in the 90s. Why could they see the world through women’s eyes.

But at least I could be a fan. Silly, shallow, simple, S.H.E., the Taiwanese pop band of three female singers, had one album after another. Quickly they had lots of fans and became as popular as other best selling Taiwanese singers in Chinese world.

Ang Lee’s films had been uneasy to understand for me. This movie is esp. lovely by people as its topic is shallow, simple and silly. The widowed man was a Chinese cuisine master and had been thinking, oh, just have sex again until my girls have married themselves. He must have been very sick and unsatisfied with his sex life. This movie is all about his hunger. The same thing happened to the elder daughter who had been dreaming in a poor country through Taiwan’s economy was booming. The smartest one of the three was a business woman in sales, who finally got nothing actually. Seen as a Herr of her father’s tricky skills and whole Chinese classic culture, she was beautiful. The youngest married herself earliest, just as Jane Austen had written. Could we say the whole family were silly as none of them was in the right path regarding to marriage and sex life.

Well, as a movie lover, I had the feeling that the director had been used to things needing lots of steps to make, which is advanced level or difficult in recipes. The band has faded out from our adult life and I have missed the years of being a crazy teenager fan. One night, I was in a KFC and a teenager girl was just sitting there after attending a concert. They, I mean the teenagers, were easy going and she had a little chat with me about her idol. Healthy, sunshine, harmless, these idols should be very careful with their public figures.
