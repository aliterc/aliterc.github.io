## Ze Li

_I am a senior media company manager working for Wong Yong and Zhu Chen magazine. After graduated from Cardiff University with a failed dissertation talking about frauds endlessly, lacking journalistic skills, I got an offer from Vancouver Film School for film production. I read The Guardian film reviews. I have applied for NYU Tisch school twice. I don't read entertainment news. I know a little about lightning and sculpting. Dr Richard Clayton from Cambridge Univeristy once gave me an [interview](https://allenneptune.wordpress.com/2018/05/03/appendices/). I had shortly stayed in print shops and then wanted to make my own weekly online channel SEV7ENPLUS. After that, I shot photos and shared them online COVELNEPTUNE with a moving workstation. I found that I hardly know any Americans though film making really needs Americans._
