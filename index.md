## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/aliterc/aliterc.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/aliterc/aliterc.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

ZE LI document/ public/

ZE LI, male, born in 1990 in China, Chinese citizen, single, not a gay, not a Communist

No crime records
Healthy, no big health issues; slim, not a good slave like Sam in Gone with the wind. 168cm, no chest, no shoulder, 60kg, not good looking.

Email: covelneptune@gmail.com
Mail address: not a home owner yet, you could send me things to my office or my temporary address if I rent

Expertise/ Career records
I chose to be in an art pathway in China’s higher education, I hadn’t worked until I joined Coca-Cola China in 2016, where I worked briefly as a marketing data collector. During my one month or less working there I managed to get paid but scored zero in sales. The rest of my time was not for sale, which means I have been tending kids at home. I am an English speaker. I have spent three years in the UK, unpaid work and travel. I can’t speak French, Japanese, Korean, Thai, German, Spanish, Italian (So, American and British companies are welcomed).

Apart from sales, I have been a technical support. In my portfolio, you could find (if there is an internet problem you could not load my website) my contribution to art works. Journalism is like architecture, Prof Duncan Bloy said in his book Law and media’s introduction. In 2013 I tried to make pouring oil in RealFlow, dust and rubbish on carpet in Maya for scenes in a video. Politics is for a job, like engineering is also for a job. In 2018 I tried to recover “lost connections”, missing families or potential families, for a magazine’s three issues.
