## Ze Li

_I am a senior media company manager working for Wong Yong and Zhu Chen magazine. After graduated from Cardiff University with a failed dissertation talking about frauds endlessly, lacking journalistic skills, I got an offer from Vancouver Film School for film production. I read The Guardian film reviews. I have applied for NYU Tisch school twice. I don't read entertainment news. I know a little about lightning and sculpting. Dr Richard Clayton from Cambridge Univeristy once gave me an [interview](https://allenneptune.wordpress.com/2018/05/03/appendices/). I had shortly stayed in print shops and then wanted to make my own weekly online channel SEV7ENPLUS. After that, I shot photos and shared them online COVELNEPTUNE with a moving workstation. I found that I hardly know any Americans though film making really needs Americans._

**Sick on bed**

Old professor a déguster avec une bonne choins maison.

Professor muffin tin could cook. It was a well known fact. He got married with a man finally. It was a fact with a legal document. It was a fact that he had to prepare lunchbox for himself again. He woke up at 5a.m., while his husband was going to buy sandwiches at noon. He couldn’t bear sand, witches as his life had become a sand tower on the beach. He needed fat for the afternoon. He was cooking himself boiled pork with dry chilis as he enjoyed that his meal would dedicate in the office: sometimes it would still be hot after whole morning. He sometimes blogged about the recipe, which ended up to be a successful blog. They ousted other buyers of newly built house. His colleagues talked about him like “the present incumbent of the department will soon be retiring...” Finding a husband is a long shot, but well worth trying. 

Sweden was cold. He was half retired but still had to keep getting money in. As we have said, he married a Taiwanese. Every Chinese would say Mao meets Jiang. It was a very practical choice: both of them were old- skins loosening- and they both held a long time EU visa. Others would say Muffin Tin finally found his father again. According to documents. his father died in a small town in Taiwan because of illness in 1960s. His father’s treatment was hampered by lack of funds. His interest of looking for his father never had a resurgence. After learning so many languages, he began to speak Swedish afresh. But most of the time he was filled by memories like a boat with no scupper. 

Mr Qi, who was five years old younger, smelt the chili oil, made a complaint, then continued sleeping but after 5 minutes, fully awake. Muffin T boiled the pork slices, put them aside. He then put the sauces, Sichuan bean paste, dry chilis and Sichuan pepper in, plus cooking wine, this and that, and the bean sprouts, brought to bubbling oil. He switched on the cooker hood, verser the spices onto the cooked meat, répartir 5g la garniture de coriandre. Serve with fried rice. He took a photo with his Nikon DC, found a way to make friends with married women and hungry kids which he still hated. Mr Qi went out to a breakfast shop, ordered crab porridge, this and that, completely ignoring he married a chef. He then drove a car to his studio. Morning chat was omitted as both of the house owners needed to pay for that expensive country. Muffin Tin ate an apple, his pills and kept checking his blue lunch bag during the morning hours. 

**Mr Muffin**

Middle aged businessman was entre SA, no sex but missing, à SC, sex but no string, maximum selon l'ambiance.

The welsh driver went out to shopping, found lost something, backtracked and went back home. His car inadvertently slipped into the river in Cardiff. A helicopter was put at their disposal to shot the movie. Muffin was the name of a student who was completing his PhD candidature. As Welsh Echo divulged, some chat supposed to be private had been widely published according to sources in the crew. Water filled his esophagus and windpipe. The car was locked. The forgotten man gave a second spell “streptococcus” into the war. He remembered Muffin made him parchemin en pâte d'amande with un message écrit au cornet “slow/araf”. J’en reprends par gourmandise, Mr Muffin said about gay behavior. He made him cupcakes in his apple store like house in Hangzhou. “Préparer vos moules à muffins, my dad, et déposer une caissette en papier dans chaque empreinte. Préchauffer le four à 180°C,” he read the manual in Chinese. They couldn’t understand each other by then. “Préparer de la crème chantilly et une poche à douille. He filled the poche à douille. There was no dissent from the view that science and art could (not) match. He was fasting. The welsh driver knew he was a land dealer, potentially rich rich, so he seduced him, broke his longtime repressiveness. Sex has long been a thorn in the side of holding a religious life. He conspired to incite Muffin’s struggling between no sex and putting himself in 419, even with a man. The driver was lucky that Kent police didn’t allege him to have forced a man into sexual relationship, which would be 20 years. The sex, which Mr Muffin had declared illegal, had nonetheless happened for 600 nights. His happiness had been bottled up for years. Coca-Cola could be expired. It should be slow, or fast to undermine the rich Chinese’ resistance to a foreign working class man? He was taken aback by the fact that the man knew nothing about sexual transmitted diseases. The man was unrepentant regarding to his dangerous habits and carelessness. His prudence corrected the profligacies of the free Muffin. Warm water was cascading down his body. He held Muffin’s hands, pulled him into the shower. 

Mr muffin resided in neighbouring towns, where people could see city lights from a distance. 

**Billy Yin**

Young Chinese financier introduced to future tense.

The commuters of a bus from Pudong to line 7 had to get up at 5 am to arrive at work at 9. His health was like a train’s possibility of derailment on an unchecked track. Frequencies and voices pounded into his ear from early morning to late at night. His ears heard hisses, people talking, cursing, quarrels, even when there was only him in the office. It was not really a surprise for him when he heard that there was some hearing deterioration. It was the top end of the conversations, the vital the precise things he was not hearing so well. When he was asked his favorite songs for the year, he answered, TV presenter’s voices are worse, though radio was quite an early piece of invention but absolutely exquisite. He liked choral music in which men and women don’t speak as a human should do, music in young person’s guide to the orchestra (music for all children), and above all, it should have characters to be recognized. Like mixed seafood flavor instant noodle: it got characters. People like him can’t survive from urban density, he understood it. The desert was good for him: it was silent. His sister was on TV and had been a regular. The host gave briefs of news, then prepared to go deeper into every piece of news. “here is our journalist Katie Yin in Islamabad.” “President has met Pakistan president for one belt one road and more trade deals with the cotton rich country. One belt one road was good, the president said. They have also talked about building the largest embassy of China in the country. The president said they must turn this time of challenge into more shops of oppos. “Let’s see an optimistic future, let us pull together, let us work together, and let us together to lead East Asian economic zone to a better ahead...”” Oh god, please say something meaningful... Billy Yin stared at the silent Sony TV on the wall, doing the every 20 minutes rest for 20s rule for his eyes. He was not doing that actually, he just moved his eyes from a 25*80 monitor to an IMAX. They had to keep the news open as Bloomberg is not available even on a Bloomberg terminal. Quick sell and buy, they had to behave faster than sports photographers. Anyway, policies influence economic behaviors and in a military mission, he just needed to obey orders. It gave him a moment of peace. His Shanghainese colleague once told him a trick to break young people’s suffering in big cities: eat less spice, cook light meals like eggs with tomatoes, spend more on clothes, be gentle and nice, and smoke. He was not local, he had been introduced to future tense.

1003 La cuisine thaï est riche d’influences indonésiennes, vietnamiennes, japonaises, chinoises ou encore indiennes. Elle offre ainsi une immense variété de plats appréciés dans le monde entier. Le riz et la noix de coco sont des ingrédients récurrents dans la cuisine thaï tout comme les plantes aromatiques, les condiments et les épices, ce qui en fait une cuisine particulièrement parfumée, voire parfois explosive par l’utilisation intense du piment.

- 1114 Bring existing websites from a remote server to your local site root

Learn how to establish a connection to a website's remote server and download the files to your computer, to edit in Dreamweaver.
You can use Dreamweaver to copy an existing remote site (or any branch of a remote site) to your local disk and edit it there, even if you didn’t use Dreamweaver to create the original site. You must have the correct connection information, and connect to the site’s remote server, before you can edit the site.

[Scenario](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/scenario?q=Scenario) /səˈnærioʊ/  when you want to bring websites from a remote server and edit them

Sometimes you have to work on websites that are already published on the web, and for which you no longer have the files.

In such a scenario, you can bring in the files to your local system and edit them in Dreamweaver.

High-level workflow

To get files from a remote server to edit them in Dreamweaver, do the following tasks:

Create a local folder to contain the existing site and set up the folder as the local folder for the site.

For more information, see Set up a local version of your site.

Set up a remote folder, using the remote access information about the existing site. You must connect to the remote site to download the files to your computer before you can edit them. 

For more information, see Connect to a publishing server.

Make sure to choose the correct root folder for the remote site.

In the Files panel (Window > Files), click the Connects To Remote Server button (for FTP access) or the Refresh button (for network access) in the toolbar to view the remote site.

Edit the site:

If you want to work with the entire site, select the root folder of the remote site in the Files panel, and click Get File(s) from Remote Server in the toolbar to download the entire site to your local disk.

If you want to work with just one of the files or folders of the site, locate the file or folder in the Remote view of the Files panel, and click Get File(s) from Remote Server in the toolbar to download that file to your local disk.

Dreamweaver automatically duplicates as much of the remote site’s structure as is necessary to place the downloaded file in the correct part of the site hierarchy /ˈhaɪərɑːrki/. 

Once the files are downloaded, you can see the files appear in the Files panel.

After you are done with your edits, you can then repost the new versions of the files back to the server, or you can set up another remote site in relation to this same local directory /daɪˈrektəri/, and post the edited files to a different server entirely.

A kitchen in a rented room in Paris, Chinese- arab- black part. MONICA LIN, restaurant owner and former teacher, wears a silk pale green roman style tunic. His boyfriend, we can't see him, orders an 8 euro takeaway from a Thai restaurant. A Walmart reciept is on the plan de travail, curry paste reduced, 5, coconut milk... She feels fainted because the airconditioning is not working. The gas has ran out. She calls her father who hates her for affidavit relating to the claim for unfair dismissal by Kent University where she was an employee. The stove is donated to YMCA, which has only been used for a month. It was from John Lewis. She heats the pan over light heat until very hot (smoking). She adds the coconut milk, can, and cooks until oil seperats from the milk. Avoir un teint d'endive... she is to be as pale as ghost as there is no sunshine in the room. She opens a bottle of cocacola to avoid falling down. She then adds curry paste, other ingredients. The steak was in the fridge, also donated to YMCA used for a month. Her cooking is professional and accurate: no drop of water is on the floor, on her cloth. 

Blind version: 

It's daily food. Hardly any working people has strength left after a day. Women, after work, still need to cook.

The quest continues into the deepest night, stopping periodically at likely-seeming spots, and at one stage, for a meal from a local mayor. There is mostly nothing to do but talk, but the occasion inspires something other than ribaldry. When they see how heart-stoppingly beautiful the mayor's daughter is, they become thoughtful, solemn. Kenan is reduced to inexplicable tears. Mortality has become very real, as it always will, to any of us, in the middle of the night. And always the presence of that victim – out there somewhere in the rainy blackness – nags at their minds, exhuming dark thoughts. Ceylan shows that it has a sobering, clarifying, perhaps even ennobling effect." 

- 1104 Hailstorms ravage French Bordeaux vineyards
_his face had withstood the ravages of time_

BORDEAUX [bɔʁdo] (Reuters) - Violent hailstorms ravaged parts of the Bordeaux wine region in southwestern France on Saturday causing major damage in hundreds of vineyards with thousands of hectares of vines destroyed, producers said on Monday.

This comes just a year after the Bordeaux region suffered one of its worst harvests in history with a fall of 39 percent on year due to late frosts, which lead to a jump in prices.

The hail first hit the south of the region on Saturday at midday, affecting the Pessac-Leognan [pɛsak leɔɲɑ̃] region and the south of Medoc [meˈdɔk], home to some of the region’s most famous chateaux, Bernard Farges, head of Bordeaux producers’ union CIVB, said.

It then devastated vineyards of Cotes de Bourg and Cotes de Blaye [blaj] on the right bank of the Gironde [ʒiʁɔ̃d] river and, further east, in the Gensac and Pessac-sur-Dordogne.

The vineyard of Cognac was also hit by hail. Officials mention an initial figure of 10,000 hectares (24,710 acres) affected out of a total 70,000 hectares. They had also been affected by frosts last year.

“The figures...which will have to be refined, show that between 500 and more than 1,000 wine growers have been affected with a area hit of 1,000 hectares in the Medoc, between 4,000 and 5,000 hectares for Cote de Blaye and Cote de Bourg and about 1,000 hectares in the vicinity of Gensac”, Farges told Reuters.

Some winemakers lost 100 percent of their harvest, he said.

There are 112,000 hectares of vines in the entire Bordeaux vineyard, the second-largest wine producing region in France after Languedoc Roussillon [lɑ̃ɡdɔk ʁusijɔ̃].

Last year France’s total production had fallen to a record low due to a series of poor weather incidents including spring frosts, drought and storms that affected most of the main growing regions including Bordeaux and Champagne.

Bordeaux wine prices rose 16 percent in the first six months of the 2017/18 season, farm ministry data released in March showed.

- Basics

Maya is the premier application for creating compelling 3D digital content, including models, animation, visual effects, games, and simulations.

The work you do in Maya generally falls into these categories:

Creating models. Polygons, Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS), and subdivision surfaces are different object types with different ways of modeling. Each has its own strengths, and different artists prefer working with different types.

Polygons let you model a surface by building up and reshaping a number of simple surface facets. 

_A blue and green jewel that shines from a million facets_

NURBS let you easily create smooth, curving surfaces with high-level control.

Subdivision surfaces let you edit surfaces at a high level with minimum overhead data, while still letting you work with subsections of the surface as if they were made from polygons.

Character rigging. Most animations involve “characters,” articulated models such as a person, an animal, robot, or anything else that moves by articulation. Maya lets you define internal skeletons for characters and bind skin to them to create realistic movement with deformation.

Animation. Just about everything you can think of in Maya is keyable or able to be animated.

Dynamics, fluids, and other simulated effects. Maya includes a comprehensive suite of tools for simulating real world effects such as fire, explosions, fluids, hair and fur, the physics of colliding objects, and more.

Painting and paint effects. Maya includes an incredible system for using a graphics tablet (or the mouse) to paint 2D canvases, paint directly on 3D models, paint to create geometry, scriptable paint, and virtually limitless other possibilities.

Lighting, Shading, and Rendering. When you want to render a still image or movie of your scene or animation, you can create them using your choice of renderers.

- Spinal Cord Diseases

Your spinal cord is a bundle of nerves that runs down the middle of your back. It carries signals back and forth between your body and your brain. It is protected by your vertebrae, which are the bone disks that make up your spine. If you have an accident that damages the vertebrae or other parts of the spine, this can also injure the spinal cord. Other spinal cord problems include

Tumors

Infections such as meningitis and polio

Inflammatory diseases

Autoimmune diseases

Degenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy

Symptoms vary but might include pain, numbness, loss of sensation and muscle weakness. These symptoms can occur around the spinal cord, and also in other areas such as your arms and legs. Treatments often include medicines and surgery.

- 1025 ネバダ州知事選の共和党候補、親戚が不支持　「地元育ちは虚偽」

Nebada-shū chiji-sen no Kyōwatō kōho, shinseki ga fu shiji /jimoto sodachi wa kyogi/

［２３日　ロイター］ - 州知事選挙を１１月６日に控える米ネバダ州で、共和党候補アダム・ラクソルト氏（４０）の親戚が、同氏に投票しないよう呼び掛ける論説を地元紙に寄稿した。

[23-Nichi roitā] - shūchijisenkyo o 11 tsuki 6-nichi ni hikaeru Amerika Nebada-shū de, Kyōwatō kōho Adamu rakusoruto-shi (40) no shinseki ga, dōshi ni tōhyō shinai yō yobikakeru ronsetsu o djimotoshi ni kikō shita.

A Republican candidate for governor of Nevada ran into some stiff opposition on Tuesday from members of his own family, who urged voters not to pick him as the state’s chief executive.

ネバダ州司法長官のラクソルト氏は、過去に同州知事や上院議員を務め、レーガン元大統領に近かった大物政治家、故ポール・ラクソルト氏の孫。州知事選の世論調査では、支持率が民主党候補を僅差で上回っている。

Nebada-shū shihō chōkan no rakusoruto-shi wa, kako ni dō shū chiji ya Jōin giin o tsutome, rēgan moto daitōryō ni chikakatta ōmono seijika, ko pōru rakusoruto-shi no mago.-Shū chiji-sen no seronchōsade wa, shiji-ritsu ga Minshutō kōho o kinsa de uwamawatte iru.

Adam Laxalt, the 40-year-old Nevada attorney general and grandson of the late Paul Laxalt - a giant in Nevada politics - handily won the Republican gubernatorial primary and holds a razor-thin lead over Democratic opponent Steve Sisolak in opinion polls, two weeks ahead of the Nov. 6 election. 

Laxalt’s grandfather Paul Laxalt, who died in August, was one of former President Ronald Reagan’s closest political friends and served Nevada as governor and U.S. senator.

アダム・ラクソルト氏のおばやいとこを含む親戚はリノ・ガゼット・ジャーナル紙の論説で、同氏がワシントンで育ち、２０１３年に政治活動のためネバダ州に移った外部の人間だと主張。「実際にネバダ州で育ったわれわれにとって、彼が地元育ちや地元市民との深いつながりを偽って主張し続けるのを耳にするのはつらい」とし、一族の名前が利用されるのを阻止せざるを得ないと感じたと説明した。

Adamu rakusoruto-shi no oba ya itoko o fukumu shinseki wa Rino gazetto jānaru-shi no ronsetsu de, dōshi ga Washinton de sodachi, 2013-nen ni seiji katsudō no tame Nebada-shū ni utsutta gaibu no ningenda to shuchō. /Jissai ni Nebada-shū de sodatta wareware ni totte, kare ga jimoto sodachi ya jimoto shimin to no fukai tsunagari o itsuwatte shuchō shi tsudzukeru no o mimi ni suru no wa tsurai/ to shi, ichizoku no namae ga riyō sa reru no o soshi sezaruwoenai to kanjita to setsumei shita.

But in an op-ed published in the Reno Gazette Journal newspaper, a dozen of Laxalt’s relatives - including aunts and cousins - characterized the Republican nominee as an outsider who was raised in Washington, D.C. and moved to Nevada in 2013 to pursue his political ambitions.

“For those of us who were actually raised in Nevada, it’s difficult to hear him continue to falsely claim that he was raised in Nevada or has any true connections to Nevadans,” his relatives wrote, saying they felt “compelled” to protect the family name from being exploited.

ラクソルト陣営の広報担当は発表文書で、同候補には多くの親戚がおり、一部の遠戚はリベラル派の活動家や献金者だとした。

Rakusoruto jin'ei no kōhō tantō wa happyō bunsho de, dō kōho ni wa ōku no shinseki ga ori, ichibu no enseki wa riberaru-ha no katsudō-ka ya kenkin-shada to shita.

“Adam has a large family and some distant relatives are lifelong liberal activists, donors and operatives,” a Laxalt campaign spokesman said in a statement.

- 1024 Text composition methods

The appearance of text on the page depends on a complex interaction of processes called text composition. Using the word spacing, letter spacing, and glyph spacing options you’ve selected, After Effects evaluates possible line breaks and chooses the one that best supports the specified parameters.

After Effects offers two composition methods, which you choose from the Paragraph panel menu.

Adobe Single-line Composer

Offers a traditional approach to composing text one line at a time. This option is useful if you prefer to have manual control over how lines break. If spacing must be adjusted, the Single-line Composer first tries to compress, rather than expand text.

Adobe Every-line Composer

Considers a network of breakpoints for a range of lines and thus can optimize earlier lines in the paragraph to eliminate especially unattractive breaks later on. Working with multiple lines of text results in more even spacing and fewer hyphens. The Every-line Composer approaches composition by identifying possible breakpoints, evaluating them, and assigning a weighted penalty based on these principles:

Highest importance is given to evenness of letter and word spacing. Possible breakpoints are evaluated and penalized according to how much they deviate from optimal spacing.

After breakpoint penalty values are identified for a range of lines, they are squared, magnifying the bad breakpoints. The composer then uses the good breakpoints.

- India looks to tighten sexual harassment laws: government officials

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is considering tightening sexual harassment laws, government officials said on Thursday, after an avalanche of complaints of abuse lodged by women in recent weeks thrust the issue to the forefront of politics.

Changes to the laws are being considered as the government weighs different proposals to tackle harassment, one of the officials said.

“The official announcement could come next week,” said the official, who works in the prime minister’s office.

The officials declined to give any details about possible changes.

The government focus on the law has come after women’s rights groups complained that the existing laws do not go far enough to address the widespread problem of sexual harassment.

A junior government minister resigned on Wednesday after he faced sexual harassment accusations from more than a dozen women.

The allegations related to when the junior foreign minister, M.J. Akbar, was a top newspaper editor. He is the biggest casualty since the #MeToo movement in India gained traction in recent weeks.

Akbar has denied wrongdoing and said he was stepping down so that he could fight the allegations in court.

A Delhi court began proceedings on Thursday in a defamation suit filed by Akbar against one of the women who leveled accusations against him. The next hearing will be on Oct. 31.

The previous government passed a workplace harassment act and an act to amend criminal law in 2013. The latter made sexual harassment, stalking and voyeurism crimes.

But women’s groups say a requirement that accusations be made to a workplace complaints committee within three months is unfair as some women can not quickly muster the courage to take that step.

The government should review certain provisions of the sexual harassment prevention law, said Rebecca John, a lawyer who is defending the woman against whom Akbhar has filed a defamation suit.

“The provision of filing a complaint within three months should be made more flexible,” she said.

In the case of many of the recent complaints against journalists, actors and other public figures, many of which were made under the #MeToo hashtag on social media, the accusations related to incidents that happened years ago.

Women’s groups also say that the law doesn’t make clear who in a workplace is in charge of ensuring compliance and is therefore responsible if its provisions are not followed.

The workplace law also only requires an organization employing more than 10 people to set up an internal complaints committee to hear and redress sexual harassment grievances, but critics say many companies don’t do that. [AUDIO](https://github.com/aliterc/aliterc.github.io/blob/master/eb1025.m4a)

- 1023 Breakingviews - Holding: Company babysitters get deserved spanking

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Uncle Sam is finally delivering a spanking to company babysitters. The U.S. Department of Justice announced last week that it will cut back on hiring private monitors for corporate wrongdoers. Once trusted to keep the likes of Citigroup and Apple in line, these super-nannies have often turned out to be meddlers fond of excessive oversight and multi-million dollar fees.  

The original idea was to put official eyes and ears inside companies that agreed to make amends for past offenses. Bank of America, for example, accepted a monitor in 2014 to ensure compliance with its $16.7 billion dodgy-mortgage settlement, which required the bank to modify loans, help low-income borrowers and provide other consumer relief. Companies ranging from BP to Credit Suisse have in recent years accepted similar arrangements.

As Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski acknowledged in a speech last week, though, monitors put a tremendous strain on companies. He unveiled new limits that would require the watchdogs “only as necessary,” never as a “punitive” measure and “as the exception, not the rule.” Two big factors in deciding whether to appoint one: “financial cost” and “unnecessary burdens” to the business. However this policy plays out, experience suggests that it’s good news for shareholders and the public.

Even qualified monitors with solid track records can go astray. In 2013, the federal judge handling Apple’s e-book antitrust judgment appointed Michael Bromwich as the company’s overseer, a respected former prosecutor and, more recently, the lawyer for Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. The iPhone maker soon raised a stink, though, criticizing Bromwich’s $1,100-an-hour fees, overly intrusive meetings with Chief Executive Tim Cook, Chief Design Officer Jony Ive and other top executives and a bill of nearly $140,000 for two weeks of work. The judge acknowledged the “challenging relationship” in declining to renew Bromwich’s appointment after two years.

Other monitors have provoked even more controversy. In 2007, then-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie took heat for appointing his ex-boss – former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft – to oversee corrupt medical-device manufacturers. The Ashcroft firm’s bill: somewhere between $28 million and $52 million over 18 months.

Foreign bribery cases have been especially troublesome. In a 2010 hearing on chemical-maker Innospec’s guilty plea to paying bribes, a federal judge bristled at the prospect of appointing a monitor, saying she wasn’t comfortable approving “a vehicle for someone to make lots of money.” And the Justice Department left another bribery suspect, Faro Technologies, operating in limbo for two years before appointing a monitor.

The arrangement can also be riddled with conflicts, especially since the companies that pay the tab have leverage to call the shots. In 2008, for example, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi persuaded consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers, which was serving as its monitor, to water down a report on the bank’s dealings with Iran and other blacklisted countries. New York State’s then-top financial regulator, Benjamin Lawsky, fined the consulting firm $25 million six years later for lacking integrity and objectivity. The previous year it had slapped Deloitte with a $10 million penalty for similar behavior involving Standard Chartered.

Those examples are probably not the norm, given how many independent monitors are appointed—one in every three cases involving corporations over the past five years, according to Benczkowski. Yet the instances of overreach have been too numerous to ignore. What’s more, there’s no way to tell whether any monitor has been effective, because their reports are confidential. The only certainty is that the hefty cost of their services ultimately bypasses the wrongdoers themselves and falls on innocent shareholders.

The risk in reducing the role of monitors is, of course, that what replaces them — if anything does — may be worse. The new Justice Department policy raises the possibility that many corporate wrongdoers will be on their own in ensuring compliance with the terms of their legal settlements. That may work for responsible companies with tight oversight of their finances and operations. It’s small comfort, however, for an American public that has watched a parade of repeat corporate offenders churn through the DOJ and the enforcement divisions of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators in recent decades.

Holding top executives legally accountable for the transgressions of their firms would still be the most effective deterrent to corporate crime. Short of that, a business-friendly DOJ has at least seen the folly of outsourcing its watchdog role. The next step will be to prove that it can handle the job itself.

- UK car insurance premiums up for first time in 12 months - survey

(Reuters) - The cost of a [comprehensive](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/comprehensive_1?q=comprehensive+) motor insurance policy rose by one percent in Britain in the third quarter, the first rise for 12 months, a survey said on Monday.

Prices had been pushed down ahead of expected changes in the Odgen rate, used to calculate compensation for personal injuries and the Civil [Liability](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/liability?q=Liability) Bill, which includes reforms likely to reduce claims for whiplash injuries. A reduction in the volume of claims also kept a lid on prices.

This fall, however, was difficult to sustain because of ongoing pressures on repair costs, uncertainty surrounding the bill and changes to the Ogden rate,” Stephen Jones, UK Head of P&C Pricing, Claims, Product and Underwriting at Willis Towers Watson, said.

The average premium for a comprehensive policy is now 760 pounds ($1,004) according to the latest index from price comparison site Confused.com, [compiled](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/compile#compile__11) by insurance advisory company Willis Towers Watson.

The index, based on enquiries submitted to Admiral Group’s (ADML.L) Confused.com, found that prices had risen for the first time since they peaked last summer at 847 pounds.

The survey said that Britain’s exit from the European Union could delay the passage of the Civil Liability Bill and any benefits to insurers, pushing back its implementation date from April 2019.

Companies such as Admiral, RSA Insurance (RSA.L), Direct Line (DLGD.L), esure (ESUR.L) and Hastings (HSTG.L) provide motor insurance in Britain’s highly competitive insurance sector.

- 1021 Black '[lynching](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/lynching?q=lynching)' ad illustrates race [overtones](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/overtone#overtone__13), anger in U.S. campaign ads

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Many political ads in this year’s U.S. elections pack an unusually harsh and personal punch - some with racial overtones.

In Arkansas, a radio ad this week suggests white Democrats might start lynching black men. In New York, a congressman’s supporters drew attention to his black rival’s history as a rapper. In California, Ohio and Virginia, candidates and their supporters cast their opponents as terrorists. In Pennsylvania, a Republican state senator threatened to “stomp/stɑːmp/ all over” his Democratic rival’s face with golf spikes.

And in Arizona, a lawmaker’s six siblings urged voters not to re-elect their Republican brother.

While angry advertisements are a longstanding feature of U.S. politics, many ads this year made little effort to disguise their candidates’ rage, a vivid illustration of what many experts see as a [coarsening](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/coarsen#coarsen__11) of public dialogue since President Donald Trump shook up American politics.

Heavy spending for a non-presidential election cycle and the speed with which ads are spreading online is magnifying the effect. Political spending on television spots is up 19 percent from 2014, the last U.S. congressional midterm election cycle, to $2.9 billion - levels closer to spending for a presidential election, according to MAGNA, an arm of advertising agency IPG Mediabrands.

“As the amount of money in campaigns increases I think the volume of negative ads is increasing,” said Nathan Gonzales of Inside Elections, a nonpartisan /ˌnɑːn ˈpɑːrtəzn/ campaign analysis group.

A radio ad that aired this week in Arkansas in support of Republican U.S. Representative French Hill featured women with exaggerated and stereotyped African-American accents saying black voters should support Hill and Republicans because Democrats will lynch black men when “a white girl screams rape.”

Hill’s campaign did not run the ad and condemned it as “outrageous.” Hill and his Democratic opponent, Clarke Tucker, are both white.

TIED TO KAVANAUGH HEARING

The ad cites the accusation that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted a 15-year-old girl when he was a 17-year-old high school student. Kavanaugh denied the accusation, which dominated the final days of his Senate confirmation and which prompted Republicans to say Democrats had abandoned the idea of presumption of innocence.

In the ad, a woman says “white Democrats will be lynching black folk again.”

“We have to protect our men and boys,” the woman says. “We can’t afford to let white Democrats take us back to bad old days of race verdicts, life sentences and lynchings when a white girl screams rape.”

Bruce Bartlett, a senior policy adviser in the Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, called it “the most racist ad by a Republican I have ever come across.”

Vernon Robinson of Black Americans for the President’s Agenda, a political action committee, produced the ads. He defended them in a Friday telephone interview and said they will run through the elections.

“I could not believe the lunatic [fringe](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/fringe_1?q=fringe) of the Democratic Party was pushing the presumption of guilt on the accused,” Robinson told Reuters, referring to the Kavanaugh hearings, which did not have a racial aspect. “This is a serious threat to black men and the women who love them.”

Malik Russell, a spokesman for the NAACP civil rights group, called the ad “one of the worst examples of racist ignorance and historic misappropriation.” He blamed Trump for setting the tone.

“The racism, hateful and disrespectful [rhetoric](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/rhetoric?q=rhetoric) targeting immigrants, women and communities of color coming from the White House has served as a powerful enabler to those around the nation who support white supremacy,” Russell said.

The shift in tone comes as Democrats are fighting for majorities in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, which would give them more power to oppose the Republican president’s agenda.

Opinion polls generally show Democrats with a strong chance of gaining the 23 House seats they need to take a majority, with a harder battle to pick up the two seats they would need for a Senate majority in the Nov. 6 elections.

That partly explains the preponderance of negative television ads in the Senate races - with half the ads running from Sept. 4 through Oct. 1 taking a negative tone, according to an analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks political advertising. More than the 40.8 percent of House ads and 43.2 percent of governors’ ads took a negative tone, according to the study.

NEGATIVE REPUBLICAN ADS

It found that more than a third of Republican TV ads for Senate and House races were negative, which it defined as ads that solely focus on a candidate’s rival.

That is sharply higher than the 18.3 percent of Democratic Senate ads and 14.1 percent of Democratic House ads that were negative in tone. It also represented a switch from 2014, when ads by Democrats were substantially more negative than those by Republicans.

Other 2018 election ads came in for criticism for threatening violence or [perceived](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/perceive#perceive__15) xenophobia._I perceived a change in his behaviour._

Scott Wagner, a Republican challenging Democratic incumbent/ɪnˈkʌmbənt/ Tom Wolf for governor of Pennsylvania, threatened his rival with the “golf spikes” ad. Polls show Wolf has a wide lead.

“Governor Wolf, let me tell you what, between now and Nov. 6, you’d better put a catcher’s mask on your face because I’m going to stomp all over your face with golf spikes,” Wagner said in the video.

Wagner later took the ad down amid criticism from national Republican leaders, saying he had “chosen a poor metaphor.”

New York Republican Representative John Faso has repeatedly run spots against his Democratic challenger, a black former Rhodes scholar and Harvard-educated lawyer, highlighting offensive language Antonio Delgado used as a young aspiring/əˈspaɪərɪŋ/ rapper.

Delgado responded by saying his past lyrics were taken out of context in an attempt to “otherize” him from voters in one of the whitest districts of the state.

California Republican Representative Duncan Hunter ran a spot accusing his challenger, Ammar Campa-Najjar, of trying “to hide his family’s ties to terrorism.” The ad focuses on his heritage – his mother is Mexican-American and his father is Palestinian. It calls him a “Palestinian, Mexican, millennial /mɪˈleniəl/ Democrat” who is funded by “the Muslim Brotherhood” and a “security risk.”

Campa-Najjar worked in President Barack Obama’s White House and later in the Department of Labor - jobs that require security clearance. Although his Palestinian grandfather, Muhammad Yusuf al-Najjar, was accused by Israel of being involved in the 1972 massacre/ˈmæsəkər/ of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics, Campa-Najjar was born 16 years after Yusuf al-Najjar died.

Democratic candidates for Congress in Ohio and California have been similarly labeled for their respective work at a law firm that once handled lawsuits involving Libya and for having been a substitute English teacher at a Muslim high school.

- 1020 Rugby Union-Hartley and [Farrell](https://www.pronouncenames.com/search?name=Farrell) perfect fit as co-captains, says Jones

LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - England coach Eddie Jones said his decision to make Dylan Hartley and Owen Farrell co-captains for the November tests was “almost a no-brainer” though his idea that they will take the field holding hands is one of his less likely predictions.

Jones made Hartley his captain in one of his first acts after taking over as head coach and has been a [staunch](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/staunch_1?q=staunch) supporter of the hooker during England’s superb winning run and subsequent struggles.

With Hartley ruled out of this year’s South Africa tour with [concussion](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/concussion?q=concussion) issues, Farrell, a natural leader on the pitch throughout his career, took over the job seamlessly.

Now the two men will officially share the duties in a move that Jones does not see as particularly ground-breaking.

“To me it almost became a no-brainer,” he said after announcing his squad for the games against South Africa, New Zealand, Japan and Australia.

“Having watched Dylan captain the side for so many tests and then watching Owen in South Africa, the combination of those two together is just a great fit and whatever team I’ve coached where we’ve had success you’ve always had two at the top and traditionally they’ve been called a captain and a vice-captain, but I see the role as being co-captains.

“Dylan will handle certain things on the field, Owen will handle certain things, the things that come natural to him, and then off the field we’ve got a great combination because Dylan’s a bit older, Owen’s younger and that combination of looking after responsibilities off the field will work well.”

Asked who would take on the traditional captain’s roles on matchday, Jones said: “They’ll hold hands when they run out. Dylan is always next to the referee so it’s natural for him to speak to the referee. When there’s a penalty they have a discussion about what to do — they’ll work it out, it’s a very natural situation.

“We’ll use it in November and if it’s right going forward, we’ll take it right through to the World Cup.”

Jones added that his decision was partly based on the off-field demands.

“In England the job of the captain is probably the biggest job in the world,” he said. “In most of the world you do the press conference which is one little gathering of five or six people for about five minutes and then you’re done.

“Here it’s two hours of non-stop questioning and it’s the same for the captain and I want to make sure it doesn’t overburden them in their own preparation.”

Jones said he had a similar set-up, if not in name, during his time coaching Australia.

“We had John [Eales](https://www.pronouncenames.com/pronounce/Eales) as captain and George Gregan as vice-captain,” he said. “Who spoke to the referee more? George Gregan. Who was more influential in the team? George Gregan. Who was one of the greatest captains of all time? John Eales.

South Africa’s done it again. Last week, surgeons from the Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre became the first in the world to transplant a liver from a donor living with HIV.

In doing so, an HIV-positive mother was able to save the life of her HIV-negative baby — and make history.

Historically, people living with HIV have been banned from donating organs because the virus can be transmitted via donated tissue. Transplants were also thought to pose a risk to the health of donors living with the virus.

So far, doctors can’t say for sure if the baby — now a healthy, 13-month-old toddler — contracted HIV because of the procedure or not. Preliminary tests haven’t been able to say conclusively. As a precaution, the baby is still on HIV treatment and doctors say they still aren’t sure when — or if — the child will stop taking antiretrovirals (ARVs).

Still confused? Experts from Wits University and its Donald Gordon Medical Centre as well as the National Institute For Communicable Diseases have the answers.

- Anal fissure

An anal fissure is a small split or tear in the thin moist tissue (mucosa) lining the lower rectum (anus).

Causes

Anal fissures are very common in infants, but they may occur at any age.

In adults, fissures may be caused by passing large, hard stools, or having diarrhea for a long time. Other factors may include:

Decreased blood flow to the area

Too much tension in the sphincter muscles that control the anus

The condition affects males and females equally. Anal fissures are also common in women after childbirth and in people with Crohn disease.

Symptoms

Anal fissures may cause painful bowel movements and bleeding. There may be blood on the outside of the stool or on the toilet paper (or baby wipes) after a bowel movement.

Symptoms may begin suddenly or develop slowly over time.

Other symptoms may include:

A crack in the anal skin that can be seen when the area is stretched slightly (the fissure is almost always in the middle)

Constipation

Exams and Tests

The health care provider will perform a rectal exam and look at the anal tissue. Other medical tests that may be done include:

Anoscopy -- examination of the anus, anal canal, and lower rectum

Sigmoidoscopy -- examination of the lower part of large intestine

Biopsy -- removal of rectal tissue for examination

Colonoscopy -- examination of the colon

Treatment

Most fissures heal on their own and do not need treatment.

To prevent or treat anal fissures in infants, be sure to change diapers often and clean the area gently.

CHILDREN AND ADULTS

Worrying about pain during a bowel movement may cause a person to avoid them. But not having bowel movements will only cause the stools to become even harder, which can make anal fissure worse.

Prevent hard stools and constipation by:

Making dietary changes -- eating more fiber or bulk, such as fruits, vegetables, and grains

Drinking more fluids

Using stool softeners

Ask your provider about the following ointments or creams to help soothe the affected skin:

Numbing cream, if pain interferes with normal bowel movements

Petroleum jelly

Zinc oxide, 1% hydrocortisone cream, Preparation H, and other products

A sitz bath is a warm water bath used for healing or cleansing. Sit in the bath 2 to 3 times a day. The water should cover only the hips and buttocks.

If the anal fissures do not go away with home care methods, treatment may involve:

Botox injections into the muscle in the anus (anal sphincter)

Minor surgery to relax the anal muscle

Prescription creams such as nitrates or calcium channel blockers, applied over the fissure to help relax the muscles

Outlook (Prognosis)

Anal fissures often heal quickly without any more problems.

People who develop fissures once are more likely to have them in the future.

- 1018 Marking Menus

You can quickly access many of your most commonly used tools with marking menus.

Marking menus are used throughout the Maya interface. When you right-click an object, a marking menu appears that lets you select a selection mode and other actions that are in context to the type of object. Some marking menus appear when you hold a key and press a mouse button.

Marking menus are very fast for experienced users because once you get used to showing them and the positions of their items, you can select the items using very quick gestures with the mouse or tablet pen, sometimes so fast the entire menu won’t even display.

To select an item from a marking menu

Do one of the following:

Right-click anywhere in your scene when an object is selected, and release the mouse button.
The marking menu remains on the screen, letting you move your cursor over the item you want to select.

Right-click anywhere in your scene when an object is selected and continue holding your mouse button and drag in the direction of the item you want to select. It doesn't matter how far you drag or if you hit the item exactly. This allows you to make the drag very quickly. Dragging over an item with a submenu attached shows the submenu.

![img](http://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2018/ENU/Maya-Basics/images/GUID-411DFA9A-FC6F-4485-8083-5E6A6B831EA6.png)

Note: You can assign marking menus to hotkeys. Hold the key and press the mouse button to show the marking menu.

Polygon / NURBS marking menus

Right-clicking a polygon or NURBS object in the scene brings up a marking menu of many commonly used commands.

Menu Item: Effect

Components: The upper radial section of each object type displays options to change the current component selection mode for that object.Note: Objects remain selected even when switching between various object and component modes.

Shape node: Allows you to display the appropriate object's shape node without changing the current selection.

Select: Selects the current object.

Select All: Selects all objects in the scene.

Deselect All: Clears the current selection.

Select Hierarchy: Selects the current object and anything under it in the DAG.

Invert Selection: Selects anything currently unselected in the DAG and vice versa.

Select Similar: When in component mode, Select Similar selects polygonal components (vertices, edges, and faces) of a similar type to the current selection. When in object mode, this option selects other objects of the same node type in the scene.

Make Live: Turns the current object into a Live surface that other objects will then automatically snap to.

DG Traversal: Allows you to navigate up and down the DG into the current object's History (upstream) and Future (downstream) without having to open the Node Editor.

Inputs: Allows you to select and edit any / all input (upstream) connections to the current object's shape node.

Outputs: Allows you to select and edit any / all output (downstream) connections to the current object's shape node.

Paint: Provides quick access to multiple paint modes, including: Paint Select, 3D Paint, Sculpt Geometry, and Vertex Color painting (not available for NURBS curves).

Metadata: Allows you to visualize and modify metadata associated with the current object.

Actions: Provides quick access to Templating, (controlling the object's selectability), Unparenting (down to the root level), and Bounding Box display actions.

UV Sets: Provides quick access to options related to an object's (possibly) multiple UV sets (polygons only).

Color Sets: Provides quick access to options related to an object's (possibly) multiple color sets (polygons only).

Scene Assembly: Provides quick access to various options related to Scene Assembly for creating large complex scenes.

Material Attributes: Opens the current object's shader node in the Attribute Editor.

Assign New Material: Opens the Assign New Material window.

Assign Favorite Material: Allows you to assign commonly used shaders based on your Favorite list in the Hypershade. to the current object.

Assign Existing Material: Allows you to assign the current object any shader that already exists in the scene.

Remove Material Override: Removes any material overrides created on a render layer, reverting back to the master layer's material shader.

Convert Selection marking menus

Ctrl + right-clicking an object provides a menu of selection conversion commands that mirror those found in the Select > Convert Selection menu as well as Contiguous Edges. The available options differ depending on the current object type. See Change one type of selection to another.

Create Polygon marking menus

Shift + right-clicking the scene without a selection provides a menu of polygon primitives and creation tools.

Polygon Tools marking menus

Shift + right-clicking with a polygon object selected brings up a marking menu of many commonly used polygon tools.

- RENDERING

ZBrush provides several ways to render both 2D and 3D work. The finished render can be saved to a file by pressing the Document > Export button. For a BPR render there are additional options for saving render passes that can then be composited in an image editing program (for details see the BPR pages).

Render modes

Preview

The default renderer, used when composing a scene or sculpting. It will show most properties of the scene including Preview Shadows but excluding Light palette shadows, complex fog, light colors, depth cue and some material and other effects. It does show transparency, but the Best renderer is significantly better in most situations.

Best

Used for the final render for 2D work, the Best Renderer uses the best (and slowest) methods to produce the highest quality image. Shadows for 2D work must be rendered using this renderer.

If you try to work in the Best renderer mode, ZBrush will automatically switch to the Preview Renderer. There’s one exception to this; if you have a floating object in the scene, you can make changes to its material properties and the Best Renderer will re-render only the object and its bounding box.

Important!

The BPR (see below) is the best option for 3D models, however some materials effects require the use of the Best renderer. Best and BPR renders can be combined by first completing a Best render and immediately following it with a BPR.

Fast

The fast renderer does not render materials, only basic shading. This makes it ideal for modeling, since it is very fast and shows surface details due to geometry, not materials.

Flat

Allows you to see the scene with no shading, just basic color. This can be useful for checking texture maps.

Best Preview Renderer (BPR)

The Best Preview Renderer (or BPR) is for 3D work only. The BPR will render a 3D model in Edit mode using high quality anti-aliasing at the full document size. For full details see the BPR page.

AA Half option

The Antialiased Half-size button in the Document palette will set the zoom factor for the canvas to exactly half its size. ZBrush treats this scale factor in a special manner; when the zoom factor is exactly 50%, the canvas contents are antialiased, which reduces the “jagged” effect that can appear along edges in a computer-generated image.

A common method of working with ZBrush for 2D work is to create and draw your document at double its intended size, and then to use this button to display the antialiased version at the “final” size. The Document > Export button can then be used to export the smaller, antialiased version of your work.

For 3D models in Edit mode and using BPR, antialiasing is performed by the renderer and use of AA Half is not necessary

Image Resolution

When rendering images for print it is often a requirement that the image is of a specific resolution, for example, 300 ppi for top quality magazine or book images. ZBrush does not have a way to specify the resolution of an image – all images are rendered at their exact pixel dimensions (though note AA Half above). In order to render an image of the right size for a particular resolution you need to calculate the pixel dimensions. The simplest way to do this is to set up a blank file in an image editor like Photoshop and then note down the Image Size height and width in pixels.

In ZBrush you then need to resize the document in the Document palette. Note that you should set up the right size of document before starting a 2D illustration.

Turn off Edit mode and clear the canvas

Turn off the Pro switch in the Document palette

Set the Width and Height sliders to the pixel values you want

Press Resize

The canvas will be resized to the new dimensions. When you export a render it will be the right pixel dimensions and you can specify the resolution in Photoshop if you want.

Saving the Render to a file

To save a render simply press the Document > Export button and choose a file name and extension. Images can be saved in a variety of formats.

- About Move Actions

Move actions move selected objects a specified distance and angle.

Apply a Move Action to a Point Parameter

A move action associated with a point parameter moves all objects in a selection set in any direction. The point parameter is the location of the grip for the move action in the block reference.

![img](http://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2018/ENU/AutoCAD-Core/images/GUID-586FEB01-4E0F-4E2C-AE31-ABF5558C9C16.png)

Apply a Move Action to a Linear Parameter

A move action associated with a linear parameter moves all objects in a selection set only in the direction of the linear parameter. The parameter key point is the location of the grip in the block reference.

![img](http://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2018/ENU/AutoCAD-Core/images/GUID-D87B7D6F-ED84-4215-8CE8-29FA5BA62649.png)

Apply a Move Action to a Polar Parameter

A move action associated with a polar parameter moves all objects in a selection set in any direction. In the block reference, the parameter key point is

The location of the move grip

The offset distance from the selected objects

Applying a move action to a polar parameter gives the same result as applying a move action to a point parameter.

- ‘They have taken our beautiful sand from us and left nothing’

It was with a heavy heart that Nassire Omar, a 60-year-old fisherman, moved away from his old home in the coastal village of Nagonha in northern Mozambique/moʊzæmˈbiːk/ last year.

He abandoned the village where he had lived since 2004, after it became prone to devastating floods. Altogether, 1 300 residents left Nagonha to resettle a kilometre west of the village.

He said everything began to change when Haiyu Mozambique Mining, a subsidiary of China-based Hainan Haiyu Mining, was awarded a [concession](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/concession?q=concession) in 2011 to mine heavy sand minerals such as ilmenite, titanium/tɪˈteɪniəm/ and zircon.

Like his fellow villagers, Omar blames Haiyu’s mining operations for contributing to the floods in 2015 that almost wiped out the village, destroying 48 homes and leaving 290 people homeless.

According to research by Amnesty International, which documented the effect of the flooding in a report released earlier this year, Haiyu’s operations were likely to have contributed significantly to the 2015 flood.

With his income as a fisherman, Omar has been able to set up a small shop, which helps to support his wife and six children. But business has suffered of late.

“The company has destroyed our lives. My business is affected. I used to sell cooked food to the fishermen. They no longer come here to buy food because my business is a little far from the ocean now,” Omar said.

Satellite images of the area between December 2010 and October 2014 show the build-up of mining-related sand deposits around Nagonha. The images also reveal the gradual change in the natural flow of water.

By October 2014, the satellite imagery shows that about 2800 square metres of wetland north of the village were covered by the sand, and that the channel connecting the lagoons/ləˈɡuːn/ north of the village to the sea had been blocked.

Not only did these changes to the landscape put villagers at risk of being washed into the Indian Ocean, it also meant that Nagonha’s residents were deprived of vital natural resources provided by nearby wetlands, including drinking water, medicinal plants, wild fruit, firewood and lagoons for fishing.

Outraged by these losses, Omar has joined forces with other villagers to challenge irresponsible mining activities and to demand justice from the Chinese mining firm.

It is a classic case of David versus Goliath, but Omar said the battle was worth fighting because the abuses are too great to be ignored.

Omar said Haiyu has displayed [sheer](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/sheer_1?q=sheer) arrogance /ˈærəɡəns/ by failing to take full responsibility for its actions and exploiting the Mozambican authorities’ failure to regulate the mining industry.

Amnesty International found that Haiyu did not conduct a proper environmental impact assessment or consult Nagonha’s residents prior/ˈpraɪər/ to establishing its business, despite local legislation requiring it to do so.

“The company has been mining for almost a decade. They have taken good-quality sand from here, but if you look at Nagonha, they have done nothing to improve the community where they have been mining,” Omar said.

“Worse, they are not prepared to listen to us or correct their mistakes. It is regrettable that for seven years the company has been taking good sand from here and left us living in such poor conditions.”

Omar said Haiyu could learn from other international mining companies operating in Mozambique or elsewhere that act responsibly. “I have seen on TV that a company that has been mining in Gaza has resettled 700 households. Here they cannot resettle 229 households?”

The Chinese company has denied responsibility for the 2015 flood, citing a natural event on a scale not seen for 100 years. It rejected Amnesty International’s assertion that its operations had a negative effect on the environment.

Site of a heavy sand extraction in Nagonha carried out by Haiyu

Nagonha residents are among the most impoverished in the world, living below the poverty line. Many were hoping that the arrival of the mining company would improve their lives, but this never happened. Nagonha has no school, health facility or clean running water. For drinking water, residents rely on dug wells, which are easily contaminated. There is no sanitation, which means residents are vulnerable to infectious diseases such as [cholera/ˈkɑːlərə/](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cholera?q=cholera) and [typhoid](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/typhoid?q=typhoid).

Omar said what they want is for Haiyu to take responsibility for its actions. “They owe us because they have taken our beautiful sand from us and left nothing. We don’t know the quantity of the sand that they took over seven years, but we know that they profited from it and we want our dues. They have taken all the riches here and left us with nothing.”

Amnesty said the Mozambican authorities must immediately rectify their failure to protect the most vulnerable and ensure that the residents of Nagonha are awarded reparations/ˌrepəˈreɪʃn/ , including compensation, for their losses.

The government, it said, must also intervene to ensure that Haiyu’s mining operations do not pose a danger of further catastrophic flooding that could wipe Nagonha off the map.

- 1017 Breakingviews - China’s share-backed debt problem is a lasting one

HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China’s pledged stocks cast a long shadow. Shares have been used as collateral for some $220 billion of loans in the People’s Republic, a practice which threatens to exacerbate a nearly $2 trillion selloff this year. Beijing will step in to contain the immediate risk, but higher lending costs and moral hazard will hurt for longer.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which has been falling over trade and other concerns, last week hit lows not seen in almost four years. It is now trading below levels touched during the 2015 crash, a nosedive that has revived worries over growing use of stock to back debt.

Share pledges are common in China, usually among big investors in small, private Mainland companies, who use their stakes to secure loans of up to 60 percent of the value of the equity. If the stock price dips to a certain level – usually around 150 percent of the value of the principal and interest – then the borrowers face a margin call. If they fail to cough up, the shares are sold off by lenders to recoup losses.

The sums involved explain the concern. According to Nomura, about 9 percent of all mainland shares were pledged in the third quarter, and the outstanding lending amount stands at about 1.5 trillion yuan ($217 billion). According to estimates published by Morgan Stanley in July, pledged loans extended by Chinese brokerages are worth more than their net capital, compared to 16 percent of that number five years ago.

Regulators have already taken steps to cut the scale of borrowing, even if compliance has been patchy, and some brokerages no longer offer such loans. State intervention will certainly help limit the pain: officials have indicated they do not want to see stocks dumped. Local media reported on Saturday that the Shenzhen government was considering injecting tens of billions of yuan to reduce exactly that risk.

But shoring up short-term confidence from Beijing has a cost. For one, lenders will likely increase the cost of such borrowing to account for the risk that collateral might be frozen, a move that won’t help indebted corporates or a sluggish economy. Worse, a perennial safety net encourages bad behaviour. There is enough of that around already. [AUDIO](https://github.com/aliterc/aliterc.github.io/blob/master/EB%201017.m4a)

- Eye Care

Also called: Eye health, Eye safety

Your eyes are an important part of your health. Most people rely on their eyes to see and make sense of the world around them. But some eye diseases can lead to vision loss, so it is important to identify and treat eye diseases as early as possible. You should get your eyes checked as often as your health care provider recommends it, or if you have any new vision problems. And just as it is important to keep your body healthy, you also need to keep your eyes healthy.

Eye Care Tips

There are things you can do to help keep your eyes healthy and make sure you are seeing your best:

Eat a healthy, balanced diet. Your diet should include plenty or fruits and vegetables, especially deep yellow and green leafy vegetables. Eating fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and halibut can also help your eyes.

Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk of developing diabetes. Having diabetes puts you at higher risk of getting diabetic retinopathy or glaucoma.

Get regular exercise. Exercise may help to prevent or control diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. These diseases can lead to some eye or vision problems. So if you exercise regularly, you can lower your risk of getting these eye and vision problems.

Wear sunglasses. Sun exposure can damage your eyes and raise your risk of cataracts and age-related macular degeneration. Protect your eyes by using sunglasses that block out 99 to 100 percent of both UV-A and UV-B radiation.

Wear protective eye wear. To prevent eye injuries, you need eye protection when playing certain sports, working in jobs such as factory work and construction, and doing repairs or projects in your home.

Avoid smoking. Smoking increases the risk of developing age-related eye diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts and can damage the optic nerve.

Know your family health history. Some eye diseases are inherited, so it is important to find out whether anyone in your family has had them. This can help you determine if you are at higher risk of developing an eye disease.

Know your other risk factors. As you get older, you are at higher risk of developing age-related eye diseases and conditions. It is important to know you risk factors because you may be able to lower your risk by changing some behaviors.

If you wear contacts, take steps to prevent eye infections. Wash your hands well before you put in or take out your contact lenses. Also follow the instructions on how to properly clean them, and replace them when needed.

Give your eyes a rest. If you spend a lot of time using a computer, you can forget to blink your eyes and your eyes can get tired. To reduce eyestrain, try the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look away about 20 feet in front of you for 20 seconds.

Eye Tests and Exams

Everyone needs to have their eyesight tested to check for vision and eye problems. Children usually have vision screening in school or at their health care provider's office during a checkup. Adults may also get vision screenings during their checkups. But many adults need more than a vision screening. They need a comprehensive dilated eye exam.

Getting comprehensive dilated eye exams is especially important because some eye diseases may not have warning signs. The exams are the only way to detect these diseases in their early stages, when they are easier to treat.

The exam includes several tests:

A visual field test to measure your side (peripheral) vision. A loss of peripheral vision may be a sign of glaucoma.

A visual acuity test, where you read an eye chart about 20 feet away, to check on how well you see at various distances

Tonometry, which measures your eye's interior pressure. It helps to detect glaucoma.

Dilation, which involves getting eye drops that dilate (widen) your pupils. This allows more light to enter the eye. Your eye care provider examines your eyes using a special magnifying lens. This provides a clear view of important tissues at the back of your eye, including the retina, macula, and optic nerve.

If you have a refractive error and are going to need glasses or contacts, then you will also have a refraction test. When you have this test, you look through a device that has lenses of different strengths to help your eye care professional figure out which lenses will give you the clearest vision.

At what age you should start getting these exams and how often you need them depends on many factors. They include your age, race, and overall health. For example, if you are African American, you are at higher risk of glaucoma and you need to start getting the exams earlier. If you have diabetes, you should get an exam every year. Check with your health care provider about if and when you need these exams.

- 1016 Dandruff, Cradle Cap, and Other Scalp Conditions

Also called: Seborrhea, Seborrheic Dermatitis

Your scalp is the skin on the top of your head. Unless you have hair loss, hair grows on your scalp. Different skin problems can affect your scalp.

Dandruff is a flaking of the skin. The flakes are yellow or white. Dandruff may make your scalp feel itchy. It usually starts after puberty /ˈpjuːbərti/ , and is more common in men. Dandruff is usually a symptom of seborrheic dermatitis, or seborrhea. It is a skin condition that can also cause redness and irritation of the skin.

Most of the time, using a dandruff shampoo can help control your dandruff. If that does not work, contact your health care provider.

There is a type of seborrheic dermatitis that babies can get. It is called cradle cap. It usually lasts a few months, and then goes away on its own. Besides the scalp, it can sometimes affect other parts of the body, such as the eyelids, armpits, groin, and ears. Normally, washing your baby's hair every day with a mild shampoo and gently rubbing their scalp with your fingers or a soft brush can help. For severe cases, your health care provider may give you a prescription shampoo or cream to use. _She kicked her attacker in the groin. He's been off all season with a groin injury._

Other problems that can affect the scalp include

Scalp ringworm, a fungal infection that causes itchy, red patches on your head. It can also leave bald/bɔːld/ spots. It usually affects children.

Scalp psoriasis, which causes itchy or sore patches of thick, red skin with silvery scales. About half of the people with psoriasis have it on their scalp.

- About XMP metadata

Metadata is—in the simplest sense—data about data. In practical terms, metadata is a set of standardized information about a file, such as author name, resolution, color space, copyright, and keywords applied to the file. For example, most cameras attach some basic information to video files, such as date, duration, and file type. Other metadata can be entered as shot-list information in OnLocation or at the capture stage in Adobe Premiere Pro. You can add additional metadata with properties such as location, author name, and copyright. Because you can share, view, and use this metadata across Adobe Creative Suite applications, you can use this information to streamline your workflow and organize your files.

The Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) is the metadata standard used by Adobe applications. Metadata that is stored in other formats—such as Exif, IPTC (IIM), GPS, and TIFF—is synchronized and described with XMP so that it can be more easily viewed and managed. For example, adjustments made to images with Adobe Camera Raw are stored as XMP metadata. The XMP standard is based on XML.

A metadata schema is a collection of properties specific to a given workflow. The Dynamic Media schema, for example, includes properties such as Scene and Shot Location that are tailored for digital video projects. Exif schemas, by contrast, include properties tailored to digital photography, such as Exposure Time and Aperture Value. More general properties, such as Date and Title, appear in the Dublin Core schema. To see a tool tip with information about a specific schema or property, place the pointer over it in the Metadata panel. You can create your own schemas using commands in the Metadata panel, and you can import schemas and share them with others as XML files.

Metadata is divided into two general categories: static metadata and temporal metadata. Static metadata is metadata that applies to an entire asset. For example, the copyright and author information for a video clip apply to the entire clip. Temporal metadata is metadata that is associated with a specific time within a dynamic media asset. Beat markers from Soundbooth and the metadata generated by the Speech Search feature in Soundbooth and Premiere Pro are examples of temporal metadata.

Adobe Story also converts information from a screenplay (script) into XMP metadata that can automate the creation of shooting scripts, shot lists, and more.

You can view static XMP metadata for a file in Adobe Bridge.

After Effects scripts and expressions can read and use data stored in markers. Because XMP metadata for source footage items can be converted to layer markers, expressions and scripts can work with XMP metadata. Scripts can also operate on the XMP metadata for a file outside of the After Effects context, both for the automation of common tasks and for creative uses.

XMP metadata included in an F4V or FLV file can be read and used by ActionScript, so you can use XMP metadata to add interactivity to a video playing in Flash Player. One application of this feature is searching within an FLV file for temporal metadata, which can allow the user to begin playback at a specific word of dialog or at some other time associated with a specific temporal metadata element.

- Former NSFAS CEO Steven Zwane: 'I was not fired'

Steven Zwane, former chief executive of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS), says he was not fired.

“Contrary to certain media reports, I was not fired. I decided to resign with immediate effect because continuing with disciplinary proceedings was neither in my best interest nor in the best interest of NSFAS.”

On Friday, NSFAS said in a statement that a “termination agreement” had been reached between Zwane and his employer.

Zwane resigned on Friday — the first day of his disciplinary hearing.

On August 28, the Mail & Guardian reported that Zwane had been suspended with immediate effect, following allegations of maladministration. This was weeks after former chairperson Sizwe Nxasana resigned.

“I joined NSFAS in September 2017 to make a difference with a clear turn-around strategy that included building leadership capacity, attracting the right people to the organisation and putting processes in place to streamline work-flows and technology in the NSFAS office,” Zwane said in a statement.

“Some strides were made during my short tenure/ˈtenjər/, but I wish the organisation and its employees well in achieving a significant mandate in the future and in the implementation of the new policy.

“I would like to thank the Minister of Higher Education and Training, Naledi Pandor, and the former NSFAS board for their support and guidance. 
The broader NSFAS community, vice chancellors and student formations worked closely with me throughout the year and I appreciate their support and commitment”, Zwane said.

“I can confirm that, following the first day of disciplinary proceedings relating to allegations of maladministration against me, a mutual agreement was reached to terminate my role as chief executive at NSFAS, effective 2 October.”

All other aspects of the termination agreement are confidential between both parties, Zwane said. — News24

- Vitiligo

Vitiligo causes white patches on your skin. It can also affect your eyes, mouth, and nose. It occurs when the cells that give your skin its color are destroyed. No one knows what destroys them. It is more common in people with autoimmune diseases, and it might run in families. It usually starts before age 40.

The white patches are more common where your skin is exposed to the sun. In some cases, the patches spread. Vitiligo can cause your hair to gray early. If you have dark skin, you may lose color inside your mouth.

Using sunscreen will help protect your skin, and cosmetics can cover up the patches. Treatments for vitiligo include medicines, light therapy, and surgery. Not every treatment is right for everyone. Many have side effects. Some take a long time. Some do not always work.

- ANC: Heads must roll over 'alarming' VBS Mutual Bank report

The ANC has welcomed a final investigation report into large-scale fraud at VBS Mutual Bank, saying heads must roll where there was any wrongdoing.

The report, commissioned by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), recommended that more than 50 individuals be criminally charged and held [liable](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/liable?q=liable+) in civil proceedings, following the bank’s [implosion](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/implosion?q=implosion) earlier this year.

This includes the bank’s former executives and their associates, shareholder executives, politicians and their relatives and auditors who signed off on the bank’s “fraudulent” financials.

The report was compiled by advocate Terry Motau, who was appointed to head an investigation into the bank’s collapse.

“The ‘Great Bank Heist /haɪst/’ report is alarming and highlights the roles of a range of individuals and institutions in these heinous  /ˈheɪnəs/events,” said ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe.

“The report points towards grave abuse of authority and office as well as worrying instances of corruption.”

Mabe said the Reserve Bank was now expected to act decisively and with speed to process the recommendations in the report.

“The ANC maintains that where there [has] been wrongdoing by individuals and institutions, heads must roll, and the law must take its cause without fear or favour. The manner in which authorities process this report, will be an important indication on our nation’s commitment to renewal and ethical leadership.”

In a statement on Wednesday, the Reserve Bank said the evidence in the report was not a reflection of the innocence or guilt of any party, as not all parties had been given the opportunity to respond to the evidence.

It has previously been reported that between 2015 and early 2018, when the Reserve Bank placed VBS under curatorship due to a liquidity crisis, the chair of the bank, Tshifhiwa Matodzi — together with his co-directors and ally Robert Madzonga — facilitated the [looting](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/loot_1?q=loot) of nearly R2-billion.

Both have steadfastly maintained their innocence.

The Public Investment Corporation (PIC) welcomed the report and said it had already taken a number of steps against its two delegated directors on the VBS board, Ernest Nesane and Paul Magula.

PIC spokesperson Sekgoela Sekgoela said they were no longer employed there. 

Maqula was dismissed for incompetence in April and Nesane resigned.

The Financial Sector Conduct Authority debarred the men after the PIC applied in terms of the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act.

The PIC was in the process of applying to have them declared delinquent directors and, in consultation with the Prudential Authority, will lay criminal charges against them._credit deliquents_

With Nesane, the PIC was in the process of applying to have him struck from the roll of attorneys.

Sekgoela said the report made mention of testimony to the effect that PIC CEO Daniel Matjila was to be paid a bribe of R5 million.

Motau could not make any definitive finding on this but recommended further investigation by authorities.

Matjila responded: “I emphatically/ɪmˈfætɪkli/ reject any suggestion that I may have received R5 million to facilitate further funding for VBS Mutual Bank. In fact, the portfolio management committee of the PIC, turned down an application to put more money into VBS Mutual Bank, two days before VBS was placed under curatorship,” he said.

“Such allegations are without merit and no facts or evidence could be placed before Advocate Motau’s panel of investigation to substantiate these allegations, which I regard as malicious. However, should an investigation be instituted into these allegations, I am willing and ready to subject myself to the process.” — Fin 24 [AUDIO](https://github.com/aliterc/aliterc.github.io/blob/master/Eb%201015.m4a)

- 1014 Broadcom gets EU [antitrust](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/antitrust?q=antitrust) nod/nɑːd/ for CA Technologies deal

(Reuters) - Chipmaker Broadcom [Inc /ɪŋk/](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/inc_2) said on Friday it has obtained antitrust clearance from the European Union for its $19-billion deal to acquire software company CA Technologies Inc.

Broadcom had on Wednesday said a memo, purportedly/pərˈpɔːrtɪdli/ signed by the U.S. Department of Defense and circulated among lawmakers calling for a review of the deal, was likely fake.

The chipmaker said it now expects the deal to close on Nov. 5, as the clearance from the EU was the last regulatory hurdle.

- Boris and Brexit gym punchbags help Londoners [vent](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/vent_2) their [rage](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/rage_1?q=rage)

LONDON (Reuters) - Londoners fed up with Brexit can vent their rage with a special gym routine that includes high-intensity exercises like [pummeling](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/pummel#pummel__14) punchbags bearing photographs of some of the main players like Boris Johnson and Jean-Claude Juncker.

The 30-minute circuit /ˈsɜːrkɪt/ also features the “Theresa May Sack Race,” “Jacob Rees-Logg lifts” and “Politico Headslammer” in which participants [slam](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/slam_1?q=slam) balls on to pictures of British Prime Minister Theresa May and opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn.

There is also a “Cameron Quitters’ Corner” named after May’s predecessor/ˈpredəsesər/ David Cameron to take time out.

The Brexfit classes are being offered by fitness company Gymbox, whose boss Marc Diaper said the theme was chosen by a members’ poll of their main frustrations with living in the British capital.

Fifty two percent of respondents said Brexit, followed by rent prices and train delays.

“We thought well, what better way to actually release frustration and anger than actually put on a Brexfit class as we’ve called it, where you can actually punch your most hated politician in the face on a punch bag,” he told Reuters.

The course was designed with the help of an anger management expert, said fitness instructor Boriss Visokoborskis.

“It’s for our members to relieve/rɪˈliːv/ the stress caused by Brexit, and all the frustration they see in the mass media and internet and so on,” he added. “They are leaving our classes feeling relieved, lighter and they do something good for themselves, they work on their body.” _to relieve the symptoms of a cold_

Student Ania Jarzabkiewicz, 26, originally from Poland, said she felt “amazing” after the class.

“I have a problem to get my student loan because of Brexit, so today I really take out my frustration on this whole situation and I feel really good,” she said.

Fitness coach George, 25, said his favorite exercises were the sack races and punch bags. In this particular class, leading Brexiteer and former Foreign Secretary Johnson _bore the brunt of_ his frustration.

“It’d be wrong to punch him in the face in real life so ... doing it on a punch bag there’s nothing wrong with that, and it’s definitely a great way to get your frustration out,” he said.

With six months until Britain leaves the EU, May has yet to reach a deal on the terms of the divorce, and her plan for future trade ties has been [rebuffed](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/rebuff_1#rebuff_1__15) by both the EU and many in her own Conservative Party.

Corbyn said this week that Labour would vote against a Brexit deal based on May’s proposals, the strongest warning yet to a prime minister whose plan to leave the EU is hanging by a thread. [AUDIO](https://github.com/aliterc/aliterc.github.io/blob/master/Eb%201014.m4a)

- 1013 Scripts and utilities for working with markers

Paul Tuersley provides a script on the AE Enhancers forum for splitting layers at layer markers.

Lloyd Alvarez provides scripts on the After Effects Scripts website that do the following:

Magnum, the Edit Detector automatically detects edits in a footage layer and places a layer marker at each edit (or splits the layer into a separate layer for each edit).

Zorro, the Layer Tagger allows you to tag layers and then select, [shy, and solo](https://aescripts.com/zorro-the-layer-tagger/) layers according to their tags. The tags are appended to comments in the Comments column in the Timeline panel and can also be added as layer markers.

Layer Marker Batch Editor edits marker attributes on all selected layers, including Flash cue point attributes.

Jeff Almasol provides scripts on his redefinery website that do the following:

rd_CopyMarkers copies layer markers from one layer to any number of other layers.

rd_KeyMarkers creates new layer markers (either on the selected layer or on a new null layer) with comments that provide information about keyframes at the same times.

rd_MapTextFileToMarkers sets keyframes for the Source Text property of a text layer and sets the values to text from a text file. The keyframes are placed at times specified by layer markers on the text layer.

rd_MarkerNavigator creates a panel that makes navigating to markers and viewing their comments and other values very convenient.

rd_RemoveMarkers automatically removes markers from selected layers based on specified criteria (e.g., all markers in work area).

rd_Scooter creates a panel with controls for moving various combinations of items in time, including layer In point, layer Out point, layer source frames, keyframes, and markers.

rd_CountMarkers shows the number of markers on the selected layer.

- And the fattest bear in Alaska is ... 409 Beadnose

[ANCHORAGE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7RLp7kRiEk) (Reuters) - In an Alaska/əˈlæskə/ clash of tubby titans /ˈtaɪtn/ that has become a social media sensation, a shaggy, brown and possibly pregnant mother known as 409 Beadnose was crowned on Tuesday as Fattest Bear of 2018.

Beadnose nosed out a larger Alaska brown bear, a male called 747 – and _[likened /ˈlaɪkən/ to](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/liken-to)_ a jumbo /ˈdʒʌmboʊ/ jet – in online votes collected by staff at Katmai National Park and Preserve during a wildly popular event called Fat Bear Week. Male bears are bigger but Beadnose was [deemed](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/deem#deem__11) to be more rotund /roʊˈtʌnd/. _I deem it an honour to be invited._

“Her radiant rolls were deemed by the voting public to be this year’s most fabulous flab,” the park said on its Facebook page. “Our chubby champ has a few more weeks to _chow down on_ [lingering](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/lingering?q=lingering) salmon carcasses before she heads up the mountains to dig herself a den and savor her victory.” _a lingering smell of machine oil_

Katmai, which hugs the mountainous Gulf of Alaska coast, is known for its massive, salmon-chomping /tʃɑːmp/ ursine/ˈɜːrsaɪn/ residents._She was chomping away on a bagel._ [AUDIO](https://github.com/aliterc/aliterc.github.io/blob/master/Eb1013.m4a)

October, the month before bears go into their dens to hibernate, is when the animals work the hardest to build the body fat they need to survive winter. And October is a perfect time for nature lovers to watch Katmai’s livestream video as the park’s brown bears do their pre-hibernation gorging.

Fat Bear Week may be fun and games for human spectators, but it is serious business for bears, said Andrew LaValle, a Katmai ranger who is in charge of most of the park’s social media postings.

“This might be entertaining, especially with these beautiful majestic animals, but this is a life-or-death struggle,” he said. The bears have to eat a year’s worth of food in a few months but really start to chow down in June when sockeye salmon begin swimming upstream through the park to spawn. Bears can lose a third of their body weight while hibernating, LaValle said.

Fat Bear Week got its start in 2014 as a one-day educational event called Fat Bear Tuesday, LaValle said. It became a week-long event the next year.

Throughout the past week, park staffers have posted photos of individual bears and gathered input from viewers who selected favorites in a bracketed, tournament-style competition. This year’s competition started with 12 bears before reaching Tuesday’s Beadnose-747 faceoff.

Luckily for Katmai bears, their home holds a river teeming with fish from the world’s largest natural salmon runs. The Brooks River is a spawning site for salmon based in southwestern Alaska’s Bristol Bay.

- 1010 [Gonorrhea](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gonorrhoea#gonorrhoea__20) is a sexually transmitted disease. It is most common in young adults. The bacteria that cause gonorrhea can infect the genital tract, mouth, or anus. You can get gonorrhea during vaginal, oral, or anal sex with an infected partner. A pregnant woman can pass it to her baby during childbirth.

Gonorrhea does not always cause symptoms. In men, gonorrhea can cause pain when urinating/ˈjʊrɪneɪt/ and discharge from the penis. If untreated, it can cause problems with the [prostate](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/prostate?q=prostate) and [testicles](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/testicle#testicle__12).

In women, the early symptoms of gonorrhea often are mild. Later, it can cause bleeding between periods, pain when urinating, and increased discharge from the vagina. If untreated, it can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which causes problems with pregnancy and infertility.

Your health care provider will diagnose gonorrhea with lab tests. Treatment is with antibiotics. Treating gonorrhea is becoming more difficult because drug-resistant strains are increasing. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading gonorrhea. The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have anal, vaginal, or oral sex.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian education provider Navitas Ltd (NVT.AX) said on Wednesday it had received a A$1.97 billion ($1.4 billion) takeover bid from an Australian private equity firm and the company’s co-founder, sending its shares 20 percent higher.

The offer for the nation’s largest listed private education company was 26.4 percent higher than Tuesday’s closing price, reflecting the value the bidders put on exposure to a volatile /ˈvɑːlətl/ but high-growth business.

But with operations in Australia, North America and Britain, the Perth-based company which provides English courses for foreign students is vulnerable to tougher U.S. immigration policies, visa rules and currency movements.

The bid from a consortium /kənˈsɔːrtiəm/ led by fledgling /ˈfledʒlɪŋ/ private equity firm BGH Capital Pty /prəˈpraɪəteri/ Ltd, pension fund AustralianSuper and Navitas co-founder and top shareholder Rod Jones, lands two months after Navitas posted its first loss /lɔːs/ since listing in 2004.

“Navitas has been going sideways and as a result the share price hasn’t gone anywhere,” Morningstar analyst [Gareth](https://www.pronouncenames.com/search?name=Gareth) James said.

“A private equity firm can come in and change the strategy, make it growth-orientated, possibly do some M&A and bring it back to the market in a couple of years.”

The bid offers A$5.50 per share in cash, or A$2.75 per share in cash and one ordinary share in the new unlisted company that will own Navitas for every two shares held in Navitas.

Navitas shares hit A$5.27 in early trade, an eight-month high but still well below the offer price, amid doubts the deal will proceed. The broader market opened flat.

The bid, which requires shareholder approval, is conditional on the company keeping net debt in line with brokers’ estimates and on revenue and margin targets remaining “supportable and achievable”.

DOUBTS

[Michael](https://www.pronouncenames.com/pronounce/Michael) [McCarthy](https://www.pronouncenames.com/pronounce/McCarthy), chief market strategist at stockbroker CMC Markets, said there were also concerns about the role of board member Jones, who led Navitas until he stepped down as chief executive officer in February.

“Shareholders tend to be a bit suspicious of attempts to take a company private involving existing management, and so there’s no guarantee that this will gain shareholders’ support,” he said.

Under the deal, Jones said he would sell half his 12.6 percent stake to the consortium and roll the other half into the bidding company.

The deal was “in the best interests of all Navitas shareholders,” he said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

Navitas said the board would review the proposal. BGH had no immediate comment and AustralianSuper declined to comment.

Earlier this year, Navitas forecast a “medium-term” downturn /ˈdaʊntɜːrn/ in the United States and closed two U.S. colleges due to the impact of hardline immigration policies.

In Australia, it lost lucrative /ˈluːkrətɪv/ government contracts in 2017 but stands to benefit from surging international student enrolments, mostly from China, and a weaker Australian dollar.

- 1009  ‘Picking Up Where We Left Off’

This issue in your hand or on your screen is both a departure and a sign of continuity.
If Film Studies, the journal, sounds familiar, it is because you may have
seen in your library our earlier incarnation. Film Studies was created and edited
by Ian Christie and Michael Grant, then in the Department of Film Studies at the
University of Kent, with Murray Smith and Peter Stanfield later joining the editorial
team. The first issue of the journal appeared in 1999, with issues 1 and 2 published
by the European Humanities Research Centre of the University of Oxford
and issue 3 published by the University of Kent, before Manchester University
Press (first) adopted the journal in 2003. Its original editorial advisory board
was constituted by leading figures in the field, including Janet Bergstrom, Peter
William Evans, Thomas Elsaesser, Simon Field, Tom Gunning, Laura Mulvey,
Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, Steve Neale and Anthony Smith.

Now in 2015, Film Studies is once again part of the stable of journals of
Manchester University Press, with instructions from our editor Matthew Frost
to ‘pick up where others left off’. As the inheritors of the great traditions of film
studies at Kent, the best way we can honour the first Film Studies, is to pledge to
build on their path-breaking efforts.

One of the central ambitions of the original Film Studies was to promote and
rejuvenate a more varied, pluralistic and interdisciplinary approach to the study
of film. In approaching cinema and the moving image from several critical, conceptual
and historical perspectives, we too are committed to that ambition. This
is evident not only in the re-launch of Film Studies but in the founding of the
Centre for the Interdisciplinary Study of Film and the Moving Image at Kent,
which brings together academics working on film from several departments.
Our distinct disciplinary origins and fields of expertise are the foundation for
this collaborative and ambitious endeavour. We are, in alphabetical order, as
follows. Mattias Frey, who specialises in  historiography and historical reception
studies, film and other arts criticism, film and media culture, institutional
and media industries analysis, classical and contemporary film theory, film and
arts education as well as historical and contemporary European cinema (with
particular emphasis on German and Austrian film). Antonio Lázaro-Reboll is
currently working on Spain’s comic book production and cultures. His work on
Spanish horror cinema has put this generic tradition in contact with other world
cinemas. A historical approach to the study of Hollywood film history is the focus
of Tamar Jeffers McDonald’s teaching and research. She is currently working on
the impact of movie magazines on stardom, as well as continuing her interest in
performance, film costume and film genres. Cecilia Sayad’s research encompasses
three areas: film authorship, film criticism and the horror genre. In all of these
she investigates the shifts brought about by pressing transformations in contemporary
culture, such as digitalisation and the Internet. Peter Stanfield’s area of
expertise is American film cultures with a particular focus on genre studies and
the intermedial in popular cinema. Núria Triana-Toribio’s work has focused on
distinct aspects of Spanish cinema and its film cultures, including how traditions
and practices are constructed through film periodicals, film festivals, film institutions
and legislation. Frances Kamm, our reviews editor, is a postgraduate in Film
Studies. Her thesis looks at the relationship between the uncanny and technological
developments in the cinematic medium.

We unite several different areas of interest and five different linguistic and cultural
backgrounds. We believe that this puts Film Studies in an ideal position to
become a forum for the interdisciplinary, intercultural and intermedial study of
film. Since 1999 when the journal was founded, the arrival of digital technologies
has transformed filmmaking and diversified the forms of the moving image. We
recognise that in order to understand the evolving landscape of film practice and
the ever-changing study of film and the moving image, we need travelling companions
who have a complex understanding of how film cultures and scholarship
are being transformed constantly. We have an exemplary advisory board, distant
from us in physical location but close to our desire to reflect upon the discipline.
The content of this re-launch issue, number 12, is proof of that. Here are some
important reflections on the state of the discipline of film studies. We offer you
position papers of different length and content that address the current state of
play, how we have arrived at this point and where the field is headed. Marijke de
Valck, Mattias Frey, Susan Martin-Márquez, Vinicius Navarro, Will Straw and
Heidee Wasson are sometimes reflective, sometimes polemical or argumentative,
but they all bring their critical and authoritative voices to this conversation. They
invite us to consider the road travelled so far and that yet to be explored. And we
bring you the latest work of one of the original editorial advisory board members,
Stephen Neale.

We may have been asked to pick up where we left off, but the study of film
has been transformed in the interim and continues to evolve. Film Studies, in its
second incarnation, will contribute to and reflect on those changes. We hope you
join us in this journey.

- Dental care - adult

Tooth decay and gum disease are caused by plaque, a sticky combination of bacteria and food. Plaque begins to build up on teeth within a few minutes after eating. If teeth are not cleaned well each day, plaque will lead to tooth decay or gum disease. If you do not remove plaque, it turns into a hard deposit called tartar that becomes trapped at the base of the tooth. Plaque and tartar irritate and inflame the gums. Bacteria and the toxins they produce cause the gums to become:

Infected

Swollen

Tender

By taking good care of your teeth and gums, you can help prevent problems such as tooth decay and gum disease (gingivitis or periodontitis). You should also teach your children how to brush and floss from an early age to help them protect their teeth.

Plaque and tartar lead to a number of problems:

Cavities are holes that damage the structure of teeth.

Gingivitis is swollen, inflamed, and bleeding gums,

Periodontitis is the destruction of the ligaments and bone that support the teeth, often leading to tooth loss.

Bad breath (halitosis).

Abscesses, pain, inability to use your teeth.

Other health problems outside the mouth, ranging from preterm labor to heart disease.

Information

HOW TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR TEETH

Healthy teeth are clean and have no cavities. Healthy gums are pink and firm. To maintain healthy teeth and gums, follow these steps:

Floss at least once per day. It is best to floss before brushing. Flossing removes plaque from between the teeth and on the gums.

Brush your teeth twice a day with a soft-bristled toothbrush. Brush 2 minutes each time.

Use fluoride toothpaste. The fluoride helps strengthen tooth enamel and helps prevent tooth decay.

Replace your toothbrush every 3 to 4 months or sooner if needed. A worn-out toothbrush will not clean your teeth as well.

Eat a healthy diet. You are less likely to get gum disease if you eat healthy foods.

Avoid sweets and sweetened drinks. Eating and drinking a lot of sweets increases your risk of cavities. If you do eat or drink sweets, brush your teeth soon after.

DO NOT smoke. Smokers have more teeth and gum problems than non-smokers.

Keep dentures, retainers, and other appliances clean. This includes brushing them regularly. You may also need to soak them in a cleansing solution.

Schedule regular checkups with your dentist. Many dentists recommend having the teeth professionally cleaned every 6 months.

Regular teeth cleaning by a dentist removes plaque that may develop, even with careful brushing and flossing. This is very important for getting at areas that are hard to reach on your own. Professional cleaning includes scaling and polishing. This procedure uses instruments to loosen and remove deposits from the teeth. Routine exams may include dental x-rays. Your dentist can catch problems early, so they do not become more serious and expensive to fix.

Ask your dentist:

What kind of toothbrush you should use, and how to brush your teeth well. Ask if an electric tooth brush is right for you. Electric tooth brushes have been shown to clean teeth better than manual toothbrushes. They often also have a timer to let you know when you have reached the 2 minute mark.

How to properly floss your teeth. Overly vigorous or improper flossing may injure the gums.

Whether you should use any special appliances or tools, such as water irrigation. This may sometimes help supplement (but not replace) brushing and flossing.

Whether you could benefit from particular toothpastes or mouth rinses. In some cases, over-the-counter pastes and rinses may be doing you more harm than good, depending on your condition.

WHEN TO CALL THE DENTIST

Call your dentist if you have symptoms of a cavity that include:

Pain in the tooth that occurs for no reason or is caused by food, beverages, brushing or flossing

Sensitivity to hot or cold foods or drinks

Get early treatment for gum disease. Call your dentist if you have symptoms of gum disease that include:

Red or swollen gums

Bleeding in the gums when you brush your teeth

Bad breath

Loose teeth

Drifting teeth

South Cameroon /kæməˈruːn/  a ‘big ghost town’

Tens of thousands of English-speaking Cameroonians have fled the country ahead of the presidential vote

Ogoja — On October 7, Cameroonians will vote for their president after a long and draining campaign. Paul Biya, the 85-year-old president who has been in power for 35 years, remains the favourite, but his likely re-election takes place against the backdrop of war.

In the north, the army is fighting Boko Haram militants, which is characterised by human rights violations on both sides.

And in the southwest, a civil war against English-speaking [secessionists](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/secessionist_2#secessionist_2__4) who are demanding independence for Anglophone Cameroon — a region that has long been marginalised by the predominantly Francophone government.

The secessionists view the election as illegitimate. 

They have told their supporters not to vote and have pledged to attack polling stations.

Matthew (19) will not be voting. He asked that his full name and location not be disclosed. He’s speaking from somewhere on the Nigerian side of the Nigeria-Cameroon border, in a camp with thousands of other refugees, none of whom will be able to cast their ballot.

He says he is a rebel fighter. He came here several days ago, risking arrest by Nigerian immigration authorities, to visit his mother, who was forced from her home as a result of the unrest. Like many others, she fled into Nigerian villages with nothing but the clothes on her back, her survival at the mercy of local residents and aid organisations.

Matthew speaks in a voice that sounds far older than he is. His face has grown lines from the corners of his mouth, spreading outward, and his arms are thin. “I’m fighting because I can’t sit and fold my hands and watch innocent ones being killed, mothers being maltreated,” he said. “If I don’t fight for myself I don’t think I am safe, so it is better for me to rise up.”

He intends to go back across the border, to rejoin his fellow freedom fighters. This could be the last time he sees his mother.

Republic of Ambazonia

Matthew is one of hundreds of armed militants who have fought the Cameroonian army in waves of violence that have left at least 400 dead, according to Amnesty International. The Cameroonian government calls them terrorists.

Although the armed groups are fractured, and don’t share identical aims, most are fighting for independence for southwest Cameroon — for a new republic to be called Ambazonia, after Ambas Bay, a missionary settlement for freed slaves established in 1858.

The militants’ grievances are rooted in bitter colonial history, in which parts of this region were carved up by different foreign powers. They are also rooted in decades of misrule by Biya’s administration, which has long discriminated against the English-speaking minority that makes up 20% of Cameroon’s 24-million population.

Previously administered by the British and French colonial governments, Southern Cameroons and Western Cameroons were merged as a single independent state after a referendum in 1961. Prior to that, Southern Cameroons enjoyed brief autonomy as a United Nations trust territory. Secessionist agitations stretch as far back as the 1980s, when Fon Gorji Dinka, an Anglophone lawyer, was arrested for distributing pamphlets declaring a “Republic of Ambazonia”.

In late 2016, Matthew joined the Anaconda Squad, a rebel group, after watching his friends being shot dead by the army.

Anglophones demonstrating against the creeping imposition of French language in schools and administrative positions had been shot at, arbitrarily detained and forced to go without internet or mobile connectivity for months.

On October 1 last year, local leaders declared “independence”.

Thousands of innocents have been caught in the intense fighting that followed: Amnesty International has documented incidents of torture, arbitrary arrest and destruction of property by the military. Entire villages have been razed and people were burnt alive.

The rebels have also been implicated in human rights violations. They’ve attacked teachers refusing to participate in civil disobedience tactics such as strikes and “ghost town” protests, and have burned down close to 40 schools. Amnesty says rebel groups have killed 44 members of Cameroon’s security forces.

There is a mismatch in capacity between the opposing armies: the rebels use hunting rifles and charms to fight the government’s United States- and French-trained forces.

‘Elections will not hold’

On a recent Thursday afternoon, Prisca Otim arrived at a refugee settlement, funded by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), in Ogoja in Cross River state after hiding in thick forest for months. Children in the camp kicked a ball in the sand, sending red dust into the air. Dragging a sack and two clinging children, she queued to register for a temporary tent.

Otim’s husband had been killed by soldiers who invaded Mbakem village in southwest Cameroon. She still wears all black clothing, her head shorn in mourning. She had brought her children and a few belongings hastily gathered together across land and water. With no money, Otim had to beg for transport to the UNHCR facility.

Now there is hope for the young mother. She will be provided with a brick house — 500 permanent shelters are already being constructed for the refugees here. Otim’s children will be sent to schools in Ogoja to facilitate integration. The land that houses the settlement was provided by the Cross River government and is about 50 hectares, according to officials.

Almost 50 groups are being resettled here. UNHCR officials say about 200 refugees have been lodged, but that is nowhere near the numbers that need to be catered for.

Although 21 000 refugees have been registered in Nigeria’s south, emergency officials say the real numbers could be up to 70 000.

At least 160 000 are displaced in Cameroon, according to Amnesty International, some hiding out in hard-to-reach places. Many more are in unregistered camps in Akwa Ibom and Taraba states.

Yet the numbers are expected to rise further. The fear of violence associated with the upcoming election is sending hundreds more across the borders.

Valerie Agbor (26) trekked into the country in September. A communique stating that movements in the region would be restricted during the elections forced him and many others to leave. Villages in the region have emptied out and offices are deserted.

“Southern Cameroon is one big ghost town,” Agbor said.

But Matthew and his Anaconda Squad insist they are not going anywhere.

“I can tell you that elections will not hold in Ambazonia,” he vowed, his small frame swaying on the mat he sat on.

Many refugees here sympathise with the fighters and agree that elections should be put off in the south. Although Biya formed a language committee to address the crisis last year, most claim the effort was too late.

“We don’t want to vote,” says Patrick Assam, a 71-year-old who fled to Agbokim village months before. “We want the restoration of Ambazonia.”

Matthew says: “I have started something which I can never stop.”

He, like most secessionists and refugees, is not willing to enter into a dialogue with the government or go back to the status quo.

“I am ready to fight till the death,” he said, “ because a dead man is not scared of a coffin.”

- 1006 Queue_Comp_Sections.jsx

```markdown
/*
Queue_Comp_Sections.jsx

version 2.0

(.2 adds auto-numbering of duplicate names)
(.3 changes the script considerably: Now, layers are no longer required to have "render"
at the start of the layer name, and in fact the layer name, not the first marker comment, is used for the basename.
This is more efficient since, to put a fine point on it,
the automating of marker comments does not exist -- for example renaming, duplicating -- [whereas](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/whereas?q=whereas) layer name automation does exist)
2.0 adds an interface, with the option of turning the guide layers into non-guide layers after adding the render queue. v2.0 really is meant 
to be a docked panel.

By the guy who runs crgreen.com

This is like having multiple Work Area settings for a comp.
You must create Guide Layers to use as "[faux](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/faux?q=faux) work area markers".
Then you set the ins and outs of these layers to act as separate render starts and ends.
Then you select at least one of those layers and run the script, which will
read each selected layer's in point and out point and use those to add a new render queue item.
Also, if you DO NOT have an underscore ("_") at the beginning of the layer name of a "render layer", the layer name will
be used as the new queue item's output base name (e.g., "basename".mov, or "basename"_[#####].xxx if it is a file sequence).
If there IS an underscore at the beginning of the layer name, the comp name will be used for the queued item (the default behavior).

Update 5-23-2018 This is sort of like having multiple work area settings for a comp. To use it, you must create guide layers whose inpoints and outpoints serve as render sections. Each "render layer" layer-name NOT beginning with an underscore ("_") will be used as that render item's output base name (e.g., "basename".mov, or "basename"_[#####].xxx if it is a file sequence). Layer names beginning WITH an underscore will be ignored, and the comp name will be used as the basename of the render queue item (AE's normal "add to render queue" behavior). Select the render layers you want to use, run the script, and it adds the items to the render queue. Now with a UI and best as a docked panel. See this graphic.

- 1005 **'Beluga whale' spotted in River Thames near London**

LONDON (Reuters) - A [beluga](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/beluga?q=beluga) whale was spotted on Tuesday near [barges](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/barge_1#barge_1__12) in the River Thames near London, hundreds of miles from its normal Arctic habitat, naturalists said.

“Can’t believe I’m writing this, no joke - BELUGA in the Thames off Coalhouse Fort,” [ecologist](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ecologist?q=ecologist) Dave Andrews wrote.

Video footage showed the white mammal surfacing in the Thames near Gravesend, Kent.

“This is the most [southerly](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/southerly_1?q=southerly) sighting of a beluga we have ever seen around these shores,” Lucy Babey, head of science and [conservation](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/conservation?q=conservation) at the ORCA charity, was quoted as saying by The Mirror newspaper.

The last sighting in UK waters was in 2015 when they were spotted off northeastern England near the Northumberland coastline, but they left shortly afterwards, she added.

In 2006, a northern bottle-nosed whale died after [stranding](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/strand_2) itself in the Thames. [AUDIO](https://github.com/aliterc/aliterc.github.io/blob/master/Eb1005.m4a)

- Showdown: SA takes on the US for cheaper drugs

When the US went to bat for Big Pharma in the fight against this killer disease, South Africa wasn’t having any of it. Here’s what happened next.

Graveyard cough, white [plague](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/plague_1?q=plague), consumption. A killer by any name, TB has [stalked](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/stalk_2) the human race for [aeons](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/aeon#aeon__4), [lurking](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/lurk_1#lurk_1__11) in crowded [tenements](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tenement#tenement__4) or following miners deep underground, hanging in the air of our hospitals._These hills have been worn down over aeons of geological time._

Always there, yet [rarely](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/rarely?q=rarely) spoken.

Today, it kills more people than HIV and [malaria](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/malaria?q=malaria) combined, the World Health Organisation (WHO) reports. In South Africa, Statistics South Africa’s latest data shows TB remains the leading cause of non-violent deaths.

Yet it took the United Nations 73 years to call a meeting on TB — and only because a very [excitable](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/excitable?q=excitable) South African health minister [agitated](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/agitated?q=agitated) enough for it. [AUDIO](https://github.com/aliterc/aliterc.github.io/blob/master/Eb1005-2.m4a)

On Wednesday heads of state ratified the first UN declaration on the most deadly infectious disease on Earth. In doing so, the world committed to curing 40-million people of TB by 2022. To fulfil their promises, international leaders must also ensure that almost an equal number of people get treatment to prevent them from developing TB.

If the world lives up to its promises, it will save the nearly two-million lives lost to TB each year, according to WHO data. Another 10-million will develop the illness and survive, but with the rise of drug-resistant forms of the bacteria, they may have to forfeit their hearing — or their mental health — to the harsh drugs needed to treat drug-resistant TB.

Older, cheaper treatments for TB that is resistant to the two most commonly used TB drugs, involve at least six months of painful, daily injections. The treatment, which can take years to complete, risks patients’ hearing and psychosis is a side-effect.

Newer, shorter and kinder treatments using drugs such as bedaquiline are available — but at cost. South Africa recently negotiated a price drop for the medicine from pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson. The drug, which used to cost middle-income countries such as South Africa R42 000 a course, now costs about R6 000 for a 6-month regimen, international humanitarian organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF) says in a statement.

But that’s still too high, argues MSF’s HIV and TB advisor Sharonann Lynch.

“Drug-resistant TB is so undertested and treated because of the three C’s: cost, the complexity of treatment and the crappy cure rates. By using bedaquiline rather than the injectable [drugs] we can remove all those barriers”, she explains.

Given this, Lynch says, “the showdown between South Africa and the United States on the declaration ahead of this week’s meeting was almost inevitable”. South Africa saw nearly 333 000 TB cases in 2017, according to the World Health Organisation’s latest report.

“Of course it made sense for South Africa to go to the mat [on the TB declaration] and fight for their and other countries rights to utilise [patent] flexibilities. South Africa should be able to double the number of people on [drug-resistant] TB treatment if they had fair pricing.”

South Africa didn’t just help get TB on the table at the UN. It also took a crucial, hard line during heated negotiations on the declaration’s final wording. The country spearheaded last-minute protests over a 20 July draft statement that failed to incorporate important access to medicine issues.

The bone of contention: Language that would have affirmed countries’ rights to put patients before patents for the public good.

In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, strange parcels laced with deadly bacteria began to arrive at US office buildings, including those of high-ranking government officials. News reports showed teams in hazmat suits collecting nondescript envelopes from building and quarantining offices.

The tiny bugs inside, once inhaled, could give way to an infection known as anthrax that is almost always fatal, the US research organisation Mayo Clinic explains.

Fearing a chemical weapons attack, the US moved to begin stockpiling antibiotics to treat what could become a mass outbreak. The only trouble was that the patented medicine by pharmaceutical company Bayer was too costly for a widescale response.

So the US threatened to use the World Trade Organisation's 2001 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (Trips) to issue a compulsory license for the drug. This kind of arrangement would allow other companies to produce Bayer’s product without a patent because of the public health emergency.

Trips protects countries’ rights to safeguard access to medicine by challenging conventional patent protection on public health grounds.

Faced with the prospect of a compulsory license, Bayer chose to sell the drug to the US government at discounted rates.

Although the US has dabbled in Trips flexibilities itself, trade officials have had a nasty habit of being less welcoming when others do. Given the history, South African officials may not have been surprised when the 20 July version of the TB declaration made no mention of the tools under Trips at countries’ disposal.

It did, however, contain this line: “[We recognise] that intellectual property rights are an important incentive in the development of new health products."

MSF was quick to point out that the statement is untrue when it comes to epidemics such as TB that are concentrated in developing countries.

South Africa halted deliberations in protest and MSF’s head of its Access Campaign for affordable medicines shot back.

“For almost two months, negotiators have been in heated talks that resulted in a draft declaration that widely diverged from language in previous UN declarations on health and access to medicines,” Els Torreele said.

“This aggressive push by several countries backed by Big Pharma lobbies would severely undercut needed guarantees to protect access to vital tools and medicines for people living with TB.”

South Africa's objections led to a faceoff with US trade officials. Ultimately, South Africa succeeded in getting a scant mention of Trips into the document but not language explicitly outlining countries’ rights.

In an interview with specialist news service Intellectual Property Watch, MSF advisor Leonardo Palumbo explains the significance:

“The preamble text is meant to be descriptive. But in the text of the document, there is no corresponding operative paragraph or commitment to be agreed upon and acted upon by [UN] member states,” he says.

“This definitely wouldn't stop states from making use of Trips flexibilities, but the political declaration would not be another tool for countries to do so.”

The tensions around the issue were visible at Wednesday’s meeting as both President Cyril Ramaphosa and US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar reaffirmed their opposing stances.

“TB is not just a medical condition. Poverty, unemployment, poor nutrition, overcrowding and social stigma...fuel the spread of diseases. This means that the poor and marginalised carry a disproportionate disease burden", Ramaphosa said.

“We need to ensure drugs are affordable, we must adhere to Trips flexibilities.”

Just hours later, Azar tweeted about the US’ firm commitment to upholding patents:

“Just because an organisation has stockholders or profits doesn't mean they aren’t interested in helping to solve the health problems our world faces. Indeed, the incentives they have for innovation can make them a vital part of our efforts to confront infectious disease.

The ink is dry on the declaration. Now, activists say the real test will be whether countries put their money and actions behind bringing its words to life. Or whether they return home from New York to the same deadly silence.

But Lynch and others don’t deny it’s a victory South Africa — and others — can claim. “It’s South Africa’s right and those of countries like India to... explore utilising Trips flexibilities rather than waiting again for a drug company to take some benevolent action… and soak up the PR.

“They effectively won.”

Jair Bolsonaro: The candidate dividing friends in Brazil

At this time of year, the gaúchos are out in force.

Dressed in [pantaloons](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/pantaloons?q=pantaloons) and neckerchiefs and wearing wide-[brimmed](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/brim_1#brim_1__11) felt hats, the people of Rio Grande do Sul have just finished celebrating Semana Farroupilha (Ragamuffin week).

It is an annual festival that marks a 19th-Century uprising when the region tried to separate from the rest of Brazil. Only it did not - the state of Rio Grande do Sul remained Brazilian.

But it is still an excuse for a party. People here are proud of their heritage. In some ways, they have more in common with their [gaucho](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gaucho?q=gaucho)-loving neighbours Uruguay and Argentina than they do with other parts of Brazil.

And that makes for interesting politics in the conservative south.

Rodeos and ragamuffins

One of the big events at Ragamuffin week is the rodeo. Both men and women, all wearing their traditional wide-brimmed felt hats, mount their horses, [lasso](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/lasso_1?q=lasso) in hand, and prove their cowboy skills to the enthusiastic audience.

A commentator speaks at breakneck speed. Every minute or so, a bull dashes across the field, closely followed by a rider casting their rope.

Nineteen-year-old student Hewyllyn Carrao is sitting on the rodeo stand in her gaúcho felt hat.

The event is a bit of light relief. With less than two weeks before the first round of presidential elections, politics is the topic of most conversations at the moment.

"All you can do is laugh really!" she says of the candidates on offer this year. "I've no idea who to vote for. Nobody does anything for the people any more."

Divisions among friends
Brazil is certainly divided. Far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro is expected to win the most votes in the first round on 7 October, followed by left-winger Fernando Haddad, who replaced former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as the Workers' Party candidate.

On the other side of the rodeo field, a group of women are hosting a colonial tea. A massive rib of beef is on the BBQ.

Claudia Matiello and Raquel Oliveira are friends, but when it comes to politics they do not see eye-to-eye.

"I'm voting for Bolsonaro because I believe in change and he's going to revolutionise Brazil," says Claudia.

Raquel shakes her head in despair. She is voting for Haddad because she thinks he is the only person who can get Brazil back on the right economic track.

I ask her what she thinks about Claudia voting for Bolsonaro. "She'll see the consequences soon enough," she laughs.

Fond memories of the military

But across town in Brazil's oldest gun club, Bolsonaro would win hands-down. "The words 'order and progress' are written on the Brazilian flag," says owner Dempsey Magaldi.

"But there's total disorder and chaos in this country - we've reached a limit. It's practically civil war." He says 80% of the club's new members start learning to shoot because of security concerns. People want to be able to defend themselves because they say the government is unable to protect them.

Fellow marksman and gun shop-owner Henrique Nogueira agrees. In rural Rio Grande do Sul, he says he and his friends all want to vote for Jair Bolsonaro because he's the candidate who backs looser gun laws in response to rising violence.

Henrique remembers the time when Brazil was under military rule from 1964 to 1985 fondly.

It is a period in which hundreds of people were killed or disappeared, but Henrique says they were "years of progress, when laws were respected and there was more discipline". He thinks that when democracy was restored and the left took power "there was an inversion of values".

"Police were seen as criminals, and the criminals the good guys. Now you're seeing the results," he says, referring to the record 63,880 [homicides](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/homicide#homicide__4) in Brazil last year.

"The only option to turn this around is Bolsonaro."

Ignoring the controversies

Nicknamed "the legend" by his fans, Jair Bolsonaro has a cult following. They seem to forget - or ignore - the controversial things he has said. He told a congresswoman she was too ugly to be raped. He has also said that he would rather have a dead son than a gay son.

But supporter Felipe Moreira Gil will not have a bad word said about Jair Bolsonaro - or the military. He is wearing a T-shirt with a picture of Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra on the front. The late army colonel was accused of ordering the illegal arrest and torture of 500 left-wing activists under military rule.

"He's the biggest hero of the Brazilian people," he says. "He protected them from left-wing terrorists."

Jair Bolsonaro has also talked fondly of military rule in the past.

"It wouldn't be a bad idea," says Felipe of the idea of returning to a military-led government. "But it's not a possibility at the moment. Bolsonaro will become president so there's no reason to organise a counter-revolution."

Radical change

Regina Brunet, 21, is worried. She is out campaigning for Fernando Haddad in downtown Porto Alegre.

"If people don't have jobs, streets get more insecure and Bolsonaro appeals to that feeling," she says. "He stands for a radical change, but it's not a change that would help people. It will only make it worse."

Bolsonaro supporter Katia Rose Maciel Broca disagrees.

"Trump's changing the US isn't he?" she says. "People are resistant to change because they're out of their comfort zone. Trump was also seen as controversial - he's doing a great job. Bolsonaro will do the same."

- Your teeth are made of a hard, bonelike material. Inside the tooth are nerves and blood vessels. You need your teeth for many activities you may take for granted. These include eating, speaking and even smiling. But tooth disorders are nothing to smile about. They include problems such as cavities (also known as tooth decay), infections, and injuries.

The most familiar symptom of a tooth problem is a toothache. Others include worn-down or loose teeth. It's important that you see a dentist if you have any problems with your teeth. Fortunately, you can prevent many tooth disorders by taking care of your teeth and keeping them clean.

DIAGNOSIS
Your pain may be from a CAVITY.

SELF CARE
Make an appointment to see your dentist. Proper brushing and flossing along with fluoride rinses and coatings, as suggested by your dentist, may prevent tooth decay.

Iran oil minister [reiterates](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/reiterate#reiterate__4) Trump to blame for rising [crude](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/crude_2) prices

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran’s oil minister reiterated on Tuesday that U.S. President Donald Trump was responsible for rising oil prices, and warned that the only way to bring balance to the market was to suspend sanctions on Tehran.

The United States aims to reduce Tehran’s oil revenue to zero in an effort to force Iran’s leadership to change its behavior in the region. U.S. officials have said new sanctions will be imposed on Iran’s oil sector from Nov. 4.

Bijan Zanganeh said in an interview on state television that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries lacked the capacity to produce more oil to make up for the drop in Iranian sales.

“If Trump wants to bring stability to the oil market, he should suspend sanctions on Tehran,” Zanganeh added.

Oil prices have extended a [rally](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/rally_1?q=rally) this year on expectations the sanctions on Iran will test OPEC’s ability to replace the shortfall, despite a June agreement among the group to pump more after pressure from Trump.

Brent crude lost 37 cents to $84.61 per barrel by 1200 GMT on Tuesday after reaching a four-year high of $85.45 in the previous session.

“China and Europe will be severely damaged by the U.S. sanctions against Iran,” Zanganeh said.

China’s Sinopec Corp is halving loadings of crude oil from Iran this month, as the state refiner comes under intense pressure from Washington.

- 1002 Electric cars cast growing shadow on profits

PARIS (Reuters) - Electric cars are poised to arrive en masse in European showrooms after years of hyped concept-car launches and billions in investment by automakers and suppliers.

FILE PHOTO: The EQC, the first fully electric Mercedes car is shown at a presentation in Stockholm, Sweden September 4, 2018. REUTERS/Esha Vaish/File Photo

Now comes the hard part: selling them at a profit.

Battery models making their car-show debut in Paris this week, from PSA Group’s (PEUP.PA) electric DS3 Crossback to the Mercedes (DAIGn.DE) EQC, will erode profitability as they struggle to stay in the black, executives generally acknowledge.

But concerns are mounting that the impact could be worse, as consumers resist paying more for electrified vehicles - forcing carmakers to sell them at a bigger loss to meet emissions goals.

“What everyone needs to realize is that clean mobility is like organic food – it’s more expensive,” said Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Peugeot, Citroen and Opel manufacturer PSA.

A Sept. 25 profit warning by BMW (BMWG.DE), blamed in part on electrification costs and tightening emissions rules, was “a first alarm signal”, Tavares said in a weekend radio interview.

“Either we accept paying more for clean mobility, or we put the European auto industry in jeopardy.”

Underlining the turbulence facing automakers, British Prime Minister Theresa May will confront Conservative rebels demanding a harder Brexit stance at her party’s annual conference, just as the Paris show gets underway on Tuesday.

On its second day, the European Parliament votes on plans to cut carbon dioxide car emissions by as much as 45 percent by 2030 from an average 95 grammes per kilometer in 2021 - a goal many automakers are already in danger of missing, on pain of fines running to hundreds of millions of euros.

PRICED TO PUSH

After declining for a decade, new-vehicle carbon emissions are rising again as customers flock from cars to SUVs, and from diesel to gasoline engines. Diesels emit more nitrogen oxides and particulates, but less CO2.

Early signs suggest electric-car prices may fall sooner and faster than production costs, as carmakers adjust for stalled emissions progress and weak consumer appetite. That promises more red ink, as discounted battery car sales finally take off.

Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) has said the ID hatchback, due to open the brand’s electric onslaught next year, will be priced close to conventionally powered versions of the Golf compact.

“VW is about to launch a load of electric vehicles at the same price as gasolines, and therefore at a loss,” said Laurent Petizon, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners.

“Our interpretation is that the 2021 fines have already been factored into their sales strategy,” he said. “Rather than pay penalties they prefer to lose money on vehicles and get the market going.”

Volkswagen declined to discuss pricing in detail. “We want our electric cars to be a real alternative to a reasonably equipped Golf Diesel,” a spokesman said.

Volkswagen and Mercedes parent Daimler, which between them have announced 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in electrification investment, both warned last month that it would not be enough.

They and other carmakers are also mandated to sell more electric cars in China and a group of U.S. states led by California. More than 200 electric and plug-in model launches are already scheduled globally over the next three years.

COST GAP

Electric cars still cost 7,800 euros more to produce on average than conventional ones, AlixPartners calculates. Plug-in hybrids - which combine a smaller rechargeable battery with a combustion engine - overshoot by 5,000 euros.

When that cost gap is reflected in the price, few are sold.

Mass-market electrics such as the Renault (RENA.PA) Zoe and Nissan (7201.T) Leaf have been on sale for most of the current decade, and heavily subsidized in Europe, while Tesla (TSLA.O) has made inroads into the premium business. Yet pure-electric cars claim just 1 percent of the market overall.

Despite their higher cost, BMW plug-in models are already priced broadly on a par with diesels. The luxury carmaker acknowledges that their margins are significantly thinner.

Mercedes also says the EQC electric SUV will be priced close to its GLC cousin to tackle Tesla’s $49,000 Model 3.

“It absolutely is impacting the profitability of the industry,” said Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, which tracks vehicle pricing. “Demand doesn’t justify investment at all - it’s all regulation.”

Which is why, on this subject more than most, European carmakers talk from both sides of their mouths. While executives exude confidence for investors’ and customers’ benefit, their Brussels lobby group ACEA warns of an imminent threat to the region’s 3.4 million automotive manufacturing jobs.

“The conditions for such a systemic change clearly aren’t met, and consumers just aren’t ready for full-electric,” ACEA Secretary General Erik Jonnaert said recently.

Automotive suppliers are also feeling exposed.

“We’ve taken risks as a company,” said Jacques Aschenbroich, chief executive of Valeo (VLOF.PA), a major manufacturer of electrification components and systems. “We have invested a lot even though the market doesn’t exist.”

SCALE EFFECTS

Carmakers are demanding increased public investment in recharging networks - which may yet awaken mass demand.

Economies of scale should also bring some relief. But lithium-ion batteries, which claim 40 percent of an electric car’s value, face global cobalt and nickel shortages that will pull the other way, inflating costs as production volumes rise.

Perhaps more critically, generous government sales subsidies are unlikely to survive much growth. In markets where incentives have been dropped, electric car sales have fallen.

Renault is discounting its recently upgraded Zoe in the UK market with a 5,000 pound ($6,500) trade-in bonus, in addition to the government’s 4,500 pound plug-in incentive.

French rival PSA will price its new rechargeable hybrids to match diesel leasing rates, program director Olivier Salvat told reporters on a recent factory visit - adding that the carmaker aimed to avoid losing money on each vehicle sold.

“We don’t launch vehicles with negative operating margins,” Salvat said.

German luxury carmakers including Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi and Porsche, could put up with losses on electrified vehicles if it enables them to keep selling their biggest earners, upscale SUVs and large sedans.

That would leave mid-market competitors such as PSA and Renault, which can ill afford to sell large volumes of electric cars below cost, in a tougher bind.

“In electromobility you have to be a cost leader,” BMW research and development chief Klaus Froehlich told Reuters.

- 1001 Tesla's SEC deal provides [ammunition](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ammunition?q=ammunition) for U.S. [probe](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/probe_2), investor lawsuits

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc’s (TSLA.O) settlement with U.S. regulators will help [soothe](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/soothe?q=soothe) investors calling for more oversight of Chief Executive Elon Musk, experts said, even as it gives ammunition to short-sellers pursing separate cases and to a probe by the Justice Department.

Musk and Tesla will pay $20 million each, bring in two independent directors and have the billionaire step down as board chairman to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that Musk misled investors by tweeting he had financing for a go-private deal.

That settlement must still be approved by a court, and does not end the Justice Department probe disclosed by Tesla into Musk’s tweets or lawsuits by short-sellers and other investors alleging losses and securities law violations.

“The real worry for the company is not the SEC but private actions that follow a settlement like this,” said Charles M. Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “By paying that size fine, it bolsters investors’” claims over stock market losses, he said.

Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the SEC’s findings as part of the settlement. Neither responded to requests for comment.

Musk settled with the SEC after advisers persuaded him the terms were favorable and a lengthy court fight would not be in the best interest of the company, a person familiar with the deal said. Musk had wanted to personally pay the fine for money-losing Tesla but the SEC rejected that proposal, the person said.

Tesla shares plunged around 14 percent on Friday, the day after the SEC charged Musk with misleading investors, and are down 30 percent since his Aug. 7 tweet saying he was considering taking the company private at $420 a share.

Investor claims could result in substantial settlements in cash or equity, Elson said. An equity settlement could end up diluting Musk’s roughly 19 percent stake in Tesla, further reducing his influence on the board.

Still, Tesla shares could stabilize on Monday on investor relief that the penalties were not higher and that the public face of Tesla will remain in the CEO role under added oversight, analysts said.

Tesla is expected to release third-quarter production this week, and investors are watching to see if it hit targets for the Model 3, a high-volume car. Whether Tesla made a profit likely will not be known until it reports financial results for the quarter.

The settlement disclosed by the SEC on Saturday “is a positive outcome for Elon Musk, Tesla and ultimately shareholders,” wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak, who added he expects Tesla shares to recoup some of their losses from last week.

An expanded board and new chairman offers hope “a true check on Elon will emerge and there will be greater accountability” over Musk’s statements and business targets, Spak added.

Tesla and Musk ended up accepting harsher penalties than the SEC originally proposed to settle the claims, according to the person familiar with the deal. The SEC initially was ready to accept a fine of a few million dollars and Musk’s removal as chairman for two years, but raised its demands after Musk balked at that offer, the person said.

- Common Cold

Sneezing, sore throat, a stuffy nose, coughing - everyone knows the symptoms of the common cold. It is probably the most common illness. In the course of a year, people in the United States suffer 1 billion colds.

You can get a cold by touching your eyes or nose after you touch surfaces with cold [germs](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/germ#germ__5) on them. You can also [inhale](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/inhale?q=inhale) the germs. Symptoms usually begin 2 or 3 days after infection and last 2 to 14 days. Washing your hands and staying away from people with colds will help you avoid colds.

There is no cure for the common cold. But there are treatments that can make you feel better while you wait for the cold to go away on its own:

Getting plenty of rest

Drinking fluids

[Gargling](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gargle_1#gargle_1__11) with warm salt water

Using cough drops or throat sprays

Taking over-the-counter pain or cold medicines

However, do not give aspirin to children. And do not give cough medicine to children under four.

Cold and Cough Medicines

Sneezing, sore throat, a stuffy nose, coughing -- everyone knows the symptoms of the common cold. It is probably the most common illness. Every year, adults get about 2-3 colds, and children get even more.

What can you do for your cold or cough symptoms? Besides drinking lots of fluids and getting plenty of rest, you may decide to take medicines. There are lots of different cold and cough medicines, and they do different things.

[Nasal](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/nasal?q=Nasal) [decongestants](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/decongestant#decongestant__4) - [unclog](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/unclog?q=unclog) a stuffy nose

Cough suppressants - quiet a cough

Expectorants - loosen [mucus](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mucus?q=mucus) so you can cough it up

[Antihistamines](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/antihistamine?q=antihistamine) - stop runny noses and sneezing

Pain relievers - ease fever, headaches, and minor aches and pains

Before taking these medicines, read the labels carefully. Many cold and cough medicines contain the same active ingredients. For example, taking too much of certain pain relievers can lead to serious injury. Do not give cold or cough medicines to children under four, and don't give aspirin to children. Finally, antibiotics won't help a cold.

- What is vaginitis?

Vaginitis, also called vulvovaginitis, is an inflammation or infection of the vagina. It can also affect the vulva, which is the external part of a woman's genitals. Vaginitis can cause itching, pain, discharge, and odor.

Vaginitis is common, especially in women in their reproductive years. It usually happens when there is a change in the balance of bacteria or yeast that are normally found in your vagina. There are different types of vaginitis, and they have different causes, symptoms, and treatments.

What are the different causes of vaginitis?
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in women ages 15-44. It happens when there is an imbalance between the "good" and "harmful" bacteria that are normally found in a woman's vagina. Many things can change the balance of bacteria, including

Taking antibiotics

Douching

Using an intrauterine device (IUD)

Having unprotected sex with a new partner

Having many sexual partners

Yeast infections (candidiasis) happen when too much candida grows in the vagina. Candida is the scientific name for yeast. It is a fungus that lives almost everywhere, including in your body. You may have too much growing in the vagina because of

Antibiotics

Pregnancy

Diabetes, especially if it is not well-controlled

Corticosteroid medicines

Trichomoniasis can also cause vaginitis. Trichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted disease. It is caused by a parasite.

You can also have vaginitis if you are allergic or sensitive to certain products that you use. Examples include vaginal sprays, douches, spermicides, soaps, detergents, or fabric softeners. They can cause burning, itching, and discharge.

Hormonal changes can also cause vaginal irritation. Examples are when you are pregnant or breastfeeding, or when you have gone through menopause.

Sometimes you can have more than one cause of vaginitis at the same time.

What are the symptoms of vaginitis?
The symptoms of vaginitis depend on which type you have.

With BV, you may not have symptoms. You could have a thin white or gray vaginal discharge. There may be an odor, such as a strong fish-like odor, especially after sex.

Yeast infections produce a thick, white discharge from the vagina that can look like cottage cheese. The discharge can be watery and often has no smell. Yeast infections usually cause the vagina and vulva to become itchy and red.

You may not have symptoms when you have trichomoniasis. If you do have them, they include itching, burning, and soreness of the vagina and vulva. You may have burning during urination. You could also have gray-green discharge, which may smell bad.

How is the cause of vaginitis diagnosed?
To find out the cause of your symptoms, your health care provider may

Ask you about your health history

Do a pelvic exam

Look for vaginal discharge, noting its color, qualities, and any odor

Study a sample of your vaginal fluid under a microscope

In some cases, you may need more tests.

What are the treatments for vaginitis?

The treatment depends on which type of vaginitis you have.

BV is treatable with antibiotics. You may get pills to swallow, or cream or gel that you put in your vagina. During treatment, you should use a condom during sex or not have sex at all.

Yeast infections are usually treated with a cream or with medicine that you put inside your vagina. You can buy over-the-counter treatments for yeast infections, but you need to be sure that you do have a yeast infection and not another type of vaginitis. See your health care provider if this is the first time you have had symptoms. Even if you have had yeast infections before, it is a good idea to call your health care provider before using an over-the-counter treatment.

The treatment for trichomoniasis is usually a single-dose antibiotic. Both you and your partner(s) should be treated, to prevent spreading the infection to others and to keep from getting it again.

If your vaginitis is due to an allergy or sensitivity to a product, you need to figure out which product is causing the problem. It could be a product that you started using recently. Once you figure it out, you should stop using the product.

If the cause of your vaginitis is a hormonal change, your health care provider may give you estrogen cream to help with your symptoms.

Can vaginitis cause other health problems?

It is important to treat BV and trichomoniasis, because having either of them can increase your risk for getting HIV or another sexually transmitted disease. If you are pregnant, BV or trichomoniasis can increase your risk for preterm labor and preterm birth.

How can I prevent vaginitis?

To help prevent vaginitis

Do not douche or use vaginal sprays

Use a condom when having sex

Avoid clothes that hold in heat and moisture

Wear cotton underwear

- 0913 How Myanmar forces burned, looted and killed in a remote village

On Sept. 2, Buddhist villagers and Myanmar troops killed 10 Rohingya men in Myanmar's restive Rakhine state. Reuters uncovered the massacre and has pieced together how it unfolded. During the reporting of this article, two Reuters journalists were arrested by Myanmar police.

INN DIN, Myanmar – Bound together, the 10 Rohingya Muslim captives watched their Buddhist neighbors dig a shallow grave. Soon afterwards, on the morning of Sept. 2, all 10 lay dead. At least two were hacked to death by Buddhist villagers. The rest were shot by Myanmar troops, two of the gravediggers said.

“One grave for 10 people,” said Soe Chay, 55, a retired soldier from Inn Din’s Rakhine Buddhist community who said he helped dig the pit and saw the killings. The soldiers shot each man two or three times, he said. “When they were being buried, some were still making noises. Others were already dead.”

- Rashes

Also called: Dermatitis, Skin rash

A rash is an area of irritated or swollen skin. Many rashes are itchy, red, painful, and irritated. Some rashes can also lead to blisters or patches of raw skin. Rashes are a symptom of many different medical problems. Other causes include irritating substances and allergies. Certain genes can make people more likely to get rashes.

Contact dermatitis is a common type of rash. It causes redness, itching, and sometimes small bumps. You get the rash where you have touched an irritant, such as a chemical, or something you are allergic to, like poison ivy.

Some rashes develop right away. Others form over several days. Although most rashes clear up fairly quickly, others are long-lasting and need long-term treatment.

Because rashes can be caused by many different things, it's important to figure out what kind you have before you treat it. If it is a bad rash, if it does not go away, or if you have other symptoms, you should see your health care provider. Treatments may include moisturizers, lotions, baths, cortisone creams that relieve swelling, and antihistamines, which relieve itching.

The last Focac in 2015, held in Johannesburg, saw China pledge $60-billion to Africa in the form of loans, export credits and grants.

Focac is ostensibly about improving economic ties and helping Africa fulfil its development potential. This year, Chinese President Xi Jinping spared no sentimentality in his references to China’s “brother” —Africa.

- Viewpoint: Ortega's Nicaragua crisis evokes memories of past

The upset woman was a former member of the Sandinista rebel group, which successfully rose up against President Anastasio Somoza in 1979, thereby putting an end to more than 40 years of bloody rule by his family.

Now, four decades on from the overthrow of Somoza, she was taking to the streets against the government of Daniel Ortega, himself a former rebel and Sandinista leader.

- COPD

COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) makes it hard for you to breathe. The two main types are chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The main cause of COPD is long-term exposure to substances that irritate and damage the lungs. This is usually cigarette smoke. Air pollution, chemical fumes, or dust can also cause it.

At first, COPD may cause no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, symptoms usually become more severe. They include

A cough that produces a lot of mucus

Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity

Wheezing

Chest tightness

Doctors use lung function tests, imaging tests, and blood tests to diagnose COPD. There is no cure. Treatments may relieve symptoms. They include medicines, oxygen therapy, surgery, or a lung transplant. Quitting smoking is the most important step you can take to treat COPD.

Note: Run the sample script Demo Palette.jsx to get an idea of what sorts of things you can do with scripts.

3 Write and modify scripts

You can write your own scripts for use in After Effects by using the script editor, which is part of the ExtendScript Toolkit. The ExtendScript Toolkit provides a convenient interface for creating, debugging, and testing your own scripts. Sometimes, all that you need to do is make a slight modification to an existing script to make it do what you want; such slight modifications can often be performed with little knowledge of computer programming and scripting languages.

Twelve years ago this week, I woke up in a wrecked vehicle on a front line road in eastern Sri Lanka. My neck was broken, I was paralyzed from the shoulders down and it took a matter of seconds to conclude my life was probably over.

- Privileged people don’t need politics

It’s a Friday night, the first one after Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa is announced as Zimbabwe’s second democratically elected president. I am in the capital, Harare, where I have come to meet a friend for a late lunch and a strong drink after enduring one of the hardest weeks Zimbabwe has ever lived through.

- Scripts

A script is a series of commands that tells an application to perform a series of operations. You can use scripts in most Adobe applications to automate repetitive tasks, perform complex calculations, and even use some functionality not directly exposed through the graphical user interface. For example, you can direct After Effects to reorder the layers in a composition, find and replace source text in text layers, or send an email message when rendering is complete.

- Genital Warts

Genital warts /wɔːrt/ are a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by the human papillomavirus /ˌpæpəˈloʊmə/ (HPV). The warts usually appear as a small bump or group of bumps in the genital area. They are flesh-colored and can be flat or look bumpy like cauliflower. Some genital warts are so small you cannot see them. In women, the warts usually occur in or around the vagina, on the cervix, or around the anus. In men, genital warts are less common. They may have warts on the tip of the penis, around the anus, or on the scrotum, thigh, or groin. She still loves him, warts and all.

You can get genital warts during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with an infected partner. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading HPV. The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have anal, vaginal, or oral sex. HPV vaccines may help prevent some of the HPV infections that cause genital warts.

Your health care provider usually diagnoses genital warts by seeing them. The warts might disappear on their own. If not, your health care provider can treat or remove them. HPV stays in your body even after treatment, so warts can come back.

- 0906 Commentary: Why Trump’s ‘Arab NATO’ plan won’t curb Iran

The first round of what U.S. President Donald Trump called “the most biting sanctions ever imposed” against Tehran went into effect on August 7. “Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States,” Trump continued, in a tweet posted that morning. An even more damaging second round of U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic, reinstated after Washington pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, is expected to take effect in November.  

Yet economic pressure is not the only tool the United States and its allies are using to counter Iran. In recent months, the Trump administration has been quietly working to forge a new security alliance, with the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and Oman – as well as Egypt and Jordan, to counter what it views as aggressive Iranian expansion in the region. Tentatively known as the Middle East Strategic Alliance (MESA) – but already nicknamed “Arab NATO” by the international press ­– U.S. and Arab officials say the coalition is being planned in an effort to expand cooperation on counterterrorism, missile defense and military training, partly to address the security challenges posed by Iran and its proxies.

- There will be a giant flame- breathing dragon on Toronto roads this weekend

There is a workshop in this city where a [ragtag](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ragtag?q=ragtag) collective of creative Toronto folks are working in the belly of giant metal beasts. Near Dupont and Ossington, it is known as The 4tress, and this is the hub of Toronto’s [mutant](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mutant_1?q=mutant) vehicle movement.

Also known as art cars, there are currently four of them in various states of construction, with metal frames and innards being worked on by a volunteer army of artists, designers and other handy people who spend their days in the advertising industry or working on sets for the TV and film production and other trades.

Heavy Meta is test fired after its head was swung into position.  (BERNARD WEIL / TORONTO STAR)

Heavy Meta is a fire-breathing dragon that is fully functioning and has already made over a dozen trips to Burning Man and other regional events. It will be on display during Pride at the stage at 526 Church St. from 5 p.m. Saturday..

Also in development are the boat-inspired Ark Car, the all-female-led Tarna the Jackalope, and another that the team hopes to keep under wraps and make a splash with upon completion.

Inspired by Burning Man, where art cars and other contraptions are part of that desert-based festival’s counter-culture movement, the ringleaders of this local movement — which literally declares itself a travelling circus when it crosses the border — are Kevin Bracken and Marie Poliak, a husband-and-wife team who have designed several of these machines, along with fabricator Matt Von Wilde.

Bracken is one of the founders of Newmindspace, the crew that gained prominence for running events like the Pillow Fights and Lightsaber battles in this city’s public squares.

“A big part of what we’ve done is because of Burning Man. We started dating there and it’s been a large part of our lives. This year will be my 13th year. Every year that I’ve gone, I’d said Toronto could use more of this,” says Bracken, 31. “Over the years, my real goal is to make Toronto more like an acid trip, to make it more like this big collective hallucination that we create together.”

Bracken and Poliak took their first vehicle, The Prodigal Swan, to Burning Man, but decided that it was too small, as it only held six people. The Swan is now permanently installed on Fremont St. in Las Vegas.

With larger ambitions, they set out to create Heavy Meta, a dragon built on a GMC school bus base that can hold over 20 people — and shoot fire out of its mouth and tail.

Stacy Campbell is the fire lead on Heavy Meta, when she’s not busy working on special effects on sets around town including The Boys, The Expanse, Umbrella Academy and American Gods. She got involved because the team was lacking people who had fire experience, and it gave her the opportunity to build her own system.

### To my lovers 
致基友

1.	First time was with you. Yes, it lasted for three or four months. Then done. I abandoned you for CET4 test. In memory, you used your company’s computer but never jumped out of the firewall. After 9 years, I still can’t get a job as good as yours. You fucking got a daily routine: home-work-home, within ten minutes of walk. I fucking got no certain home now: night is day-day is night, even can’t have three meals a day. You said you have done with women, but, you didn’t like it. And, you had had marriage arrangement. I am still amazed by you tech guys’ work without google. They use internet explore and windows. I sometimes in 2015 encountered the Reuters coach in Beijing at 5 am. I thought oh that was the company I had sent CV for years. You know, you can’t buy any printed copy of Financial Times with all pages of market and stock prices here. So I should take Qatar Airways more as they provided the newspaper on the flights. At least FT is not blocked. But still not better than the printed version. We love to print things out, don’t we? Good for eyes and really tell the difference between a printer owner and a guy only could afford a phone. 

第一次基友会面呢是和你。是的，延续了三四个月的会面。然后就分床了。我当时是在准备大学英语四级考试。记忆里，你用公司的电脑但是从来不用翻墙。九年后，我依然不能得到一份和你的一样好的工作。你生活规律啊：起床-上班-回家，十分钟路程来回。我无家可归我：白天当黑夜黑夜当白天，一天吃不了三顿饭。你说你和女的也来过，但是呢，你不喜欢。然后，有人给你相亲了。我真是对你们技术人员却不用谷歌感到惊奇。（你真的是技术人员吗？大公司真的只用内网啊？真强。）Windows真的很难用，越来越难用，有没有感觉电脑会像一块砖。除了office比苹果强，真没别的了。我2015年在北京早上五点碰见了路边的汤森路透公司班车。我想哦那就是我不停发简历从来没回复的公司。你知道呢， 国内好像买不到除了中国日报之外的英文报纸。所以我觉得有钱的话一定要到处飞，飞机上都有当天的当地报纸。印出来当然好了，大街上是个人都有手机啊，穷得只剩个手机了吧，你知道福州打印多少钱一张劣质的A4？一块。我觉得我们这一代人眼睛都有问题。进不了最好的新闻社，那就起码进一个印刷良好销量良好的杂志社啦，不行，西安工程大学，西安肉肉，听好了，那个学校的！的某个化妆师就网红了成名了微博粉丝万千了。这个，我干嘛要出国学这个媒体，在国内学个化妆就行了啊。

很多年前在海蓝心蓝的管理之下有个军警论坛，军警癖好基友交友论坛，竟然没有人管在网上曝露着。于是小小的我，心灵单纯的我，抱着各种良好的暖暖的愿望，开始唱出了自己在gay bar的第一支歌。讲越高调越才艺展示，就会有人来加qq。于是我就和基友见面了。这个故事讲全了。

2.	I was on the thought that I must marry someone immediately. Yes, gay marriage. If I had married myself to someone in Britain successfully... life won’t be so hard now. But I was kind of... it could not be done in two years, could it? First, you should like each other’s appearances and the feeling should be mutual; second, you should move together like Yajing and Josh did. I was born ugly and can’t get any fat on myself; I can’t bear to share a room with anyone. I was careless, naïve, hadn’t got any jobs so financially not a grownup. 

我抱着必须迅速嫁掉的心思。是的，喜宴。如果我已经把自己嫁掉了，生活不会是一坨屎啦。我当时是...... 结婚这个事情不是说有就有的，不是吗？首先，必须长得好看，相互吸引；其次，要住在一起做爱方便，两个人花一个人的钱，省钱。我长得丑，常年有疾病缠身，我比较怕吵不能和人共处一室。所以尽管很不小心，很傻很天真，还是不能被当作一个经济独立的大人看待，因此没人和我结婚。

这个Jeff呢，会说法语，威尔士语和英语。我呢，会讲中文，英语业余。这样呢，怎么交流。发个短信吧，哎呀呀全是口语，我还是得查。打个电话吧，哎呀呀忙啊。见个面吧，车不好，什么英国国产车，总之不是很富裕，空调都不开，GREAT CHINA送外卖的老外都是SUV四轮高底盘。总之不是一个阶层的，我他妈是知识分子，这是体力工人完全不搭边。然后有个细节，同寝室的一个没什么朋友瘦弱不善于社交的长发男生，和宿舍的修理工人甚是亲热，说什么威尔士蛋糕，我记得Jeff家里也有威尔士蛋糕...... 这个吧，难不成，是有公式的...... 自尊一地啊。

Jeff说自己四十岁，可是眼下的皱纹已经布满了，我对比了下这些十年后的当年说三十岁现在四十岁的先生们，花正好叶更红，怎么会只有四十岁。今年我又在网上翻到当地政府的生意记录，上面写作为家庭生意的继承人，这个法人代表还是什么的写的是52岁什么的。全是谎话呀。其实还好，为什么不接受自己瘦小，需要人抬行李，需要人帮助租房子，需要人帮助办签证，需要人赚钱，需要人聊天，自己简单带孩子就好。每次从西安坐硬座去北京都冷乎乎，傻兮兮以为自己不在乎很男孩子，朋友送过一次后发现强硬的军人形象背后真是需要两个人什么都不怕。所以《王勇和朱辰》我就觉得两个小孩子比一个人的冒险更好。朋友来北京看我，发现我住在很小的inconceivable不可见人的合租房的一间，我是第一次被说太不爱惜自己了。原来北京好烂。我去自己从来不去的以为是富人区的沃尔玛买了新的床单被子，借了隔壁公务员不用的阳光大房间，我自己都不舍得买的是军被军褥，为了朋友的一次光顾。

好久了。那个朋友已经离开我的生活，像很久前他说的那样，不再关心我，很忙碌有自己的战争和要争到的荣誉。我为什么一直没有感谢他的敏感。我生于社会底层，很难看到自己的劣势，对于不对的环境从不质疑；我发现光明已经穿过缝隙到别处了，我却在写一首关于昨天的诗对着流去的水花掉的钱坏掉的牛奶哭泣。我们生在未来，今天就是过去。OUT！

### 绘画心得

我真是艺术的门外汉。现在眼睛很不好，颜色辨别不准确，东西也看不清，所以很难讲是否可以继续绘画。

中学的绘画老师在学校里有一件画室。老师是个很安静的人。我的艺术教育到此为止。

以前我爸曾问过我要不要去专业学绘画，我妈强烈禁止一切艺术行为，所以我也没有选择去安静绘画一辈子。周渝民演过什么画家的角色，我觉得真的好不成功女朋友又被抢去的形象。

我自己也对专业画家充满歧视，觉得穷穷穷穷没希望。我觉得艺术真的很奢侈。其实画画是件很技术的事情，三维了之后什么粒子真的没有办法手绘（但他们的确手绘了）。

主要是，中国是个发展中国家，不是很富裕，画画是个很耗时间的事情，属于一步错步步错急不得的事情。人穷的时候就什么事情手脚快些，因为要追赶。我感觉哎，没时间，的确是，画幅画，就相当于忘记了周围，一天两天三天几个月就没了。

不计时间出最好的结果，完全违背经济生活的原则。彼得杰克逊的经验是，拖到截止日期的最后一秒。可是新西兰是发达国家啊。

我要是庙里的和尚，住在喜马拉雅山里，看着山不变几千年也就还是那样，也许可以忘记时间画些画。身体好，眼睛好，就是周围没有医院什么都买不到，现在的艺术家不都是苹果单反绘图板加最专业的绘画用品，住在雪山里不现实。

很久没有过mind blowing看艺术展的经历了。专业呀就是一道山。

### 周末

周末的英国有一个习惯就是酒吧充满人，街上都是醉酒的人。中国人没有大过周末的习惯，一般以逛街和休息为主。社交，专门时间去社交，和不认识的人说话，中国人就觉得冲破了家的温馨范围。

这个电影我看过。男一号在朋友家里做客，过后去酒吧找不认识的人。男二号出场，两人一夜情。男一号是个游泳池救生员，比较内敛，在公交车上会在意别人说什么。男二号是搞艺术的，两人收入都不高。这是在诺丁汉拍的，英国那种高层都没有人住，我在伦敦租房的时候见到过这种房子。高层像安置房，水泥森林，接地气才像家，起码是砖砌的人造的。

我不喜欢这部电影，因为男主人公们太穷了。这么平和的拍摄方法，尽管抓住了当时社会群体处境在个体上的反应，但作为电影，没有抓住我的地方，不激动，不精彩，不能让人有情感上的凭借。从剧本写作的角度讲，台词不精当，没记住。从场景和服装设计的角度讲，好穷好穷好穷好穷啊，这两个男的衣服都是地摊货，最烂最没有型的，英国街上没有工作的小流氓穿的。从表演的角度讲，总共角色就两个，演屁呀，到剧院去谁要看只有两个角色的戏， 一个配角都没有。

这样就说明我是个门外汉了。首先，英语听不懂，到英国电影院还要电影的文本才能看电影。其次，没有学习过电影理论，不懂啊什么类型什么风格什么手法什么流派。再次，我就喜欢什么打打杀杀汽车飞船战争，不喜欢两个男的谈恋爱，一点特效都没有。

总结，在没有电脑之前就有电影了。电影是一套问答，建立在语言上的交流。

问题一 浪漫两个字你是怎么理解的？

答案一 两个互不相识的人在一个安静的场合，一个人突然发现另一个很吸引他。

问题二 你认为在中国浪漫二字是否奢侈？

答案二 情人节的时候鲜花，蛋糕和酒店都极其昂贵，浪漫二字难道不贵吗？ 

问题三 谈谈你对性的看法？

答案三 吸引二字是比较自发的，神经质的，此后浇灌的时间，共同的经历不过是无法冲破距离的无用功，如果分开了不再见面了，什么法律关系都没有形成，性就成了诗句篇章而已。

### 网恋

怎么认识的？ 

这个问题很难回答，如果是网上认识的。放佛，在网上认识的就伴随着发照片，发裸体照片等不雅之事。仿佛，在网上认识的就说明这个人社交圈子有问题。

我有一阵子很迷恋网上的人。每一条微博都成了我生活中必要的提示。北京那么大，同学那么穷，言谈交往仅限于社会主义建设六个大字。生活，我不明白的生活，我现在很明白的生活，白花花地立在社会主义建设六个大字之上。

我很想在北京有一个殷实的生活，有一个家庭，不是永远住在社会主义建设的宿舍里。可是当我发现我在北京的日子即将终了的时候，我内心飘荡，那就去看世界吧，在海上漂泊一辈子。当父母不能给予我们在大城市生活的建议时，一个大十岁的人就成了生活中唯一的指南。这时候就谈恋爱了。

贫穷白花花地立在社会主义的朝阳下。大城市的贫穷触目惊心，令人颤栗。性交在恋爱的谈话氛围内显得太含蓄。我等了好久，在qq里演了好几次色情片，自费穿越半个中国，就是为了几个月一次的性交。却从没有在聊天中提及性交的字眼。

怎么认识的？

中传的同学问我，仿佛身边这样的故事太多。我没有问答。我觉得所有的性行为都在同学的对话范围之外。我有一个阳光向上的外表，和一个混乱的无法控制的个人生活。

我从未愿意和父母讨论性和婚姻。所有的探索都是直接上手的实际经历。生活的本质是一个永远转动的赚钱机器，无论父母，老师，同学，陌生人，炮友，男女朋友都没有责任帮我建。稳定的工作，没有房子，每年一月的假期，没有办法日日见面长时间相隔两地。这样的分离的关系，没有办法把两个赚钱机器扭在一起。

我现在失业。怎么认识的？

我没有生活。我没有办法组建家庭。恋爱的性交，家庭生活的目的全部不存在。我为什么要恋爱。我远离城市的喧嚣复杂，精致和势利，我不需要在网络上找一个人引领自己后十年的在大城市的生活。所有的不雅都一扫而光。这样，没有生活没有家庭，活着也就没有什么意义了。

你是反呢，还是帮凶呢？这个世界上没有第三个答案。只是好穷，没有办法做什么。

### 怎样画TIN TIN
Posted by allenneptune on 01/05/2018

我很小的时候，其实想做个画家。

后来我越来越远了。现在基本不愿意画画。

但是我的确很感兴趣丁丁历险记是怎么画的。作者是个很严肃的catholic，连上班都是在catholic的报纸。刚开始是写东西，后来就开始画漫画在报纸上连载。我发现想出书很多人都在出版行业工作，也许我应该试试。我觉得旅行是件很危险的事 （the bbc’s xxx was shot dead)，尤其是想旅行到世界的每个角落，一定是充满“历险“的。

我前几天发现一件事，丁丁应该是个考古学家，而不是记者。记者只是记录，不去想解决问题，更不会去和谁作对。

据我对漫画作者的研究，画这个漫画的工艺还是蛮复杂的。首先起线稿，线稿是很草的，不像林莹老师的线稿那么纤细，没有多余的线，这个比利时人不是专业的画画科班出身的，是自学成才的，草稿改得基本看不成。然后据我看过一个俄国插画家画画的过程，要用红蓝铅笔改，再在更大的纸上再画一遍，纸再撑在一个木框上，便于水彩上色，最后用彩铅修饰。我不太明白用什么样的纸清理草稿，因为那时没有Photoshop没法调透明度蒙着勾线。先出版的是黑白的钢笔稿，有贴图。出版之后几年再出的彩色版。我还是不明白没有Photoshop怎么把颜色加在原来的黑白线稿下面，而且可以上色上得如此均匀。

中国画的工笔画其实上色也很均匀，我不是很明白宣纸上或者丝绢上怎么颜色不会晕开。

说丁丁历险记的画家开创了一种叫“清晰的线“的绘画风格，即人物没有阴影，颜色鲜明等。

据我推测，作者的背景画得极其像照片，尽管是寥寥几笔，不像日本风格的漫画中背景那么细致地画照片，也不想美国风格中那样细致地画背景，但从背景到人物都符合现实世界中的比例，看的时候感觉作者是的确去过这些地方的。尤其是很多跨文化的地方，作者完全是在找着照片描嘛。

拿南美洲为例，丁丁系列有两个故事都是在南美发生。我看到一个秘鲁的纪录片，有一个历史遗迹就是丁丁那一本旧版的封面。林莹老师在画魔尘的时候，去西藏旅行了，我对西藏的印象完全是被林老师消化过又创作出来的，我记忆很深林老师很精细的人物服装，佛庙装饰和风雪天。

宫崎骏的工作室经常去欧洲写生。

以上只讨论一个漫画系列的地点环境服装设定，关于人物的绘画，日本漫画有自己的方法，美国漫画全是费墨的肌肉男和阴影，丁丁系列就是很省墨，人物动作完全不走形很准确。作者的分镜头不像美日漫画那样乱搞—怎么会有那么奇形怪状的摄像机取景框—基本是一张纸从上到下四个column，没有斜的分镜，都是长方形正方形的，如果占用一个分镜占用一个column以上，一定是整个两个column，绝对不会出现竖着的分割（我有点语言表达不了了）。

2d动画也是画的。在B站上看到一个樱桃小丸子的工作室参观，讲如果是电影的话，剧本就要写七八个月。动画一秒七帧，原来是用透明的塑料板上画的，背景和动画都是手绘，叠在一起用一个向下的相机照。现在背景我们能看到还是手绘的，动画都用电脑画了。李安导演的中场休息说一秒120帧，很适合慢速嘛。再看迪士尼的手绘长篇，真有耐心啊。

我觉得画画是件很旧世界的事情，我自己是个依赖新科技的人，画画这种古老的艺术形式比起摄影来讲不很适合我，即使在电脑上画。我有点怀疑视效是不是适合我了，因为在视效的背后是很传统的艺术训练，是很古老的事情。

我在做照相，录像和写文章，做网站的成套出国旅行指南。恺撒旅游好像有把自己的卡通形象称为恺恺撒撒，就像静静安安，火车上的健健康康一样。我想做个 跟燕姿和仓木麻衣 游世界，因为新加坡和日本的护照旅行太好用了。

我去过的地方很少。小时候跟着父母旅行团，上中学基本不出西安市。大学时候跟着学生社团考试找工作去了一些地方。

我集中旅行实在12-13年，每周末我都要出去逛一下。

签证，由于我们国家的护照很不好用，艾未未还是陈丹青老师很早就放弃大陆护照了，应该是后者吧，办好了台湾护照后还去问使馆这个大陆护照能不能退还了。但是网络著名旅人在换加拿大护照之前还是用中国护照环游了世界，说明不要怪政府，要怪怪自己不用心，抱怨的人脸都不好看。

我去年把自己护照扔了，上面盖了两个国家的签证页。旅行的时候都要用护照开房，落地签时上飞机去的时候就很慌，边检似乎很明白签证政策还是懒，没记得盘问我，下飞机去落地签，感觉有点小贵，坐了巴士进城找不到宾馆，远的地方自己不会开车，没敢乱跑，第二天就坐飞机回了，其实订票的时候好像就订的是隔天的返程票，只在异国待了一天，主要是一个人也没计划好，一群人就敢多待几天的。

我觉得会开车会游泳是很关键的环球旅行本领。到一个地方乘公交来来回回很傻逼，不如到了就租个车，当然公交还是要熟悉因为搞不好就要乘公交的。游泳当然是为了自救。

文化冲突会很严重吧，没事就不要去不是旅游区的地方了。

中国少了一味药 是一部描绘社会问题的书。

抛弃作者要探讨的主题，其中的描写了四件社会问题：

无家可归
穿黑巷，众入黑屋。大房，里面几个卧室。大房沙发，郝金肖庞坐上吱吱作响，无明炷，味劣，鼾声四起。 

2. 家庭问题

3. 犯罪

打人就是招新人做你的赚钱机器，让你收回成本，坐收从他销量和招人中的你的那一份。分三步：市场列表，引人，迎接。 

4. 疾病

传说中前美国驻华大使就是因为这样的压力才辞职的。因为很像中国的外籍国内问题大臣。

我以前是摄影爱好者。一遇到社会问题有相机的都喜欢用黑白表现，什么绿车皮的人挤人站票难熬的三天三夜啊，什么拆迁啊，什么乞讨啊，总之触目惊心。如果是专业的摄影记者，机器好一点，报纸上印黑白也比较吓人，所以彩色照片看着但是内容一个比一个更吓人。

看过 贫民窟的百万富翁，感觉其实也都正常，没什么大不了的。

我最近觉得好像对这本小说的改编有点思路了。

From book to film
23
by :
ReganS

Like many people, I get an initial feeling of dread when I hear that a book I like has been turned into a film. Sometimes I won’t even watch the film even though I love the story! This is a sentiment shared by many and for good reasons too. Here are, what I believe to be, the main problems with films adapted from books.

Firstly, the characters are NEVER as you imagined them. Even if a novel provides a clear physical description and detailed analysis of all of their quirks and characteristics, the character is always different. It can also be difficult when a well-known celebrity is playing the role as it is hard to separate the real-person and the character.

Secondly, if a novel is long or filled with lots of action and events it is generally impossible to condense it down into a two hour long film without cutting parts out. Of course, nowadays it has become common to split a novel into two parts, making two films. However, if there is an event in the novel that does not necessarily progress the narrative and is not something that will appeal to the majority of the audience, then it is likely to be cut from the story completely.

Thirdly, filmmakers like to use a bit of artistic license, and can sometimes change a storyline completely. This can be to suit the audience the film is being aimed at or just because they feel their interpretation is more appropriate.

Finally, a film is just one interpretation of a novel. If a novel has been read by a million people then that means there are a million versions of that novel floating around in people’s minds. Therefore it is extremely improbable that the filmmaker has the same interpretation as you, or the other 999,999 readers.

It can be annoying watching a film that completely changes a story you like. The recent, award-winning film, Silver Linings Playbook, for example, was based on a book I love. It was changed an awful lot from the book, with various characters and events completely altered. However, despite being incredibly different, it maintained the same positive, feel-good mood of the book, making it really enjoyable. Do not be deterred from watching an adaptation, just because it might be different does not mean that you will definitely not enjoy it.

贾柯樟的电影描述社会问题。玉观音也在写社会问题。能解决社会问题的非官即神。

我们只是关心一下。

成人世界和儿童世界不同，是因为成人世界鲜血淋漓的。以前一直在拍城市，城市的city line， 城市的glory，城市精致的商店，花朵，夜里醉酒胡闹的人群。

最早有一个三星的手机，不能拍照没有存储卡。很薄。后来在买电脑的公交车上丢了。是我爸给我买的。

之后买了一个诺基亚的导航手机，据说相机是蔡司的头，导航地图很强大，很windows phone一样，概念很棒。现在那个app的概念也是那个手机就有的。手机的下落不明。

之后接触了摄影，第一个是在京东上吧，分期的佳能入门级相机，不是东京进口的。画面很漂亮，比尼康的柔。拍摄了汤机场，青海支教，慕田峪长城。大二买的，大三卖掉了。感觉这些电子设备一入手就二手价了。当时修图修得很重，其实原图就很漂亮了。

后来一阵没有相机，就在豆瓣上淘了一个二手的胶片机。做地铁到北京城里什么地方，对方以为我是个年龄很大的玩家。价钱是900块。这个相机拍了毕业季的情况，还有宁波的拆迁，基督教堂，还有生活小景，很适合带在口袋里有感觉了捏一张。冲洗的时候已经三卷了，宁波有冲洗的地方，卡迪夫也有，洗出来如果对焦准确还是很漂亮的。绿色调日本风。

大四元旦买了一个尼康的相机，一万块。但是这个机器后来用于拍摄视频很多。出门拍街上的人用它，出门游玩用它，拍摄美食用它，明显感觉有点大。但是当时身边有很多专业级大相机。

研一买了苹果的机器，平板，macbook和手机都有，就不怎么用第二个诺基亚手机，我爸买给我的，当时还蛮喜欢的因为龙云在用。摄影工作室的孩子挺富的，我原来穿的都是杂牌经常去动物园西单，现在不得不买苹果的itouch和牌子货。

研一的还买了一个当时Thomas Lethaud和老刘忙都在用的松下微单，很好用很舒服很像个女朋友。在人面前捏一张声音基本听不到，又不会抖，颜色对焦都很准。问题一点是视频格式有点诡异。这个相机一般是上街乱捏用的。我那时挺有钱乱跑的，但是很多地方到了都不拍照。有点自私不发照片。图虫也删光了。后来又入了三脚架，相机包，快门线，小dv。我采访的时候也用这个拍，有点不对，应该带三脚架打灯的。但是这样可能拍着人们没有压力。

我在证件照婚礼记录店打过工，会拍证件照，可是到了英国进了证件照店人家说要培训我很久不愿用我。

后来有一阵没有智能手机用，买不起，回国买了中关村买了一个5000块的港行水货三星，晨星同款，伦敦奥运会那阵很火的带手写笔的。后来又买了一个三星的手机，后来又买了一个三星的手机，都挺烂的。

我以前用新传的机器拍得手抖，又不会拍视频，还天天剪。到现在还是不会拍。

拍摄社会问题的时候会遇到阻拦，不论是官方的，还是被拍摄方。我问过媒体法的老师街上能不能乱拍，老师讲街上的都可以拍。实际上如果是自己拍的话，比较困难，如果是卧底暗访的话，自己做更困难了。

慕容雪村先生在我留学的时候还去英国了一次。他是比较有背景的，所以可以这样卧底。

我感觉他是有一对摄影记者的眼睛的。是那种很严肃的新闻摄影记者，不是官媒拍开会飘红旗一片花海粉红色气球的。

当然他非官非神，所以他只好记录下了。当你凝视深渊时，深渊会拉你下去。

The lost happiness (China) 200 RMB day return 5h Taipei_Gaoxiong

Life is a swirl. Once we admit this, half of the miseries in it have been explained. Life is a swirl, which means if you don’t work harder, you will be dragged down to the heart of the ocean automatically.

I heard this saying in the movie Duets (2000), which had bad reviews. So, these movies mislead audience.

Happiness is saving money. When you got a bargain and get the cheapest of the same quality, you must feel happy.

Maybe it is because I got into that I have been always unhappy. I’m sick and I can’t feel very happy. I force myself into a smile and it is hard.

Happiness is you end the long years of saving money and finally buy a house in full payment. You feel fine. You feel secure.

Happiness is the nightclub with a karaoke and loud music every night finally go away from your neighborhood.

Happiness is when we don’t need to care about anything, no string attached. When we got nothing to concern, we are free. Some may say this is irresponsible. That’s because irresponsible fathers in the UK abandoned their children and wives. They have to care for them. For me, I got nothing, even don’t have shelter for the night. I don’t have to care for anyone. I’m free. I’m happy.

If a Welsh could regain their ancestors’ land, they would be happy.

If a gay man could sleep with whoever he wants, he would be happy.

If a film maker could earn a single award in major festivals, he should be happy.

But sometimes we see people crying on train back to Wales, gay man in Russia got beaten on street, director with limited means showed his pocessions to the public.

I call it the pitch, the highest and lowest in a tone. If we only pick the best moments in our life, the dish must be very expensive. So during normal days, we store the best for festivals and guests, just eat plain white bread.

Karl Max said London’s white bread were full of steel’s taste. I have experienced that. While, in China, in Familymart, white bread slices were full of sweet milk flavour. And the flavour was a little too much.

We have all kinds of unhappiness. But for sure, when sales goes up, moneys come in, efforts get paid, needs are fulfilled, no war, no disease, no pollution, no crime, everyone got happier except those who are not nice guys.

We truly have enemies.

Wales got lots of medical tourists using fake EU cards to exploit the benefits, I heard it on news. Sucking dicks, sodomy, all ways of gay sex are dangerous. Have your mum ever told you not to eat human waste? Movies, by their size of images, are not cheap. It’s absolutely a matter of money.

When we got hurt, is there a way to be healed? Yes, beat them. They dragged us down to the lowest, we must get rid of them to go back to normal.

Write a song of your life, you will find that in order to make it popular, it should remain simple and not that much up and down. Only when you want to go academic you challenge the highest and lowest, which gives you time to be alone and cut in influence. These are places where we could lose or win the battles in the war with our enemies.

Triumphs are short moments. We may feel born loser, if we always stare at those peaks.

Four o’clock in the morning. A baozi shop like Greggs in the UK, began its working day. I applied for Greggs once and I liked the sausage rolls. The owner might be sleeping on the second floor of the shop at a corner of a road cross. After having layered ten bamboo made 60cm qb containers with raw, flour and yeast made baozi, she opened the switcher of the boiler under the containers. A bored looking man walked closer to ask if the baozi were ready to eat. About 25 more containers of flour made food were waiting there to be steamed and sold. Small business like this are filling empty shops under commercial and home use buildings. They, the buildings are like a wardrobe for clean cloths. If I were a giant, I needed something, I might open these drawers, and surprisingly found small people were living in them. But finding something in so many drawers won’t be easy.

This crowded, filled with people situation made you feel small. The baozi shop had a mixer; so they don’t knead doughs by hand. The fillings might be in a fridge. A worker was putting fillings into baozi skins every 30 seconds.

It was five o’clock in the morning. Cities’ day starts at four o’clock. Sky became brighter, from dark grey to light dark blue. It was quite comfortable, cool, talking with people, doing business, down there in the baozi shop, compared with staying in an over-used, dirty, hot, bad air, toilet like cheap hostel room all day long. But, being in hotel rooms is nearer to the homes upstairs.
Soft, hot, full of air, skin not too thick not too thin, white baozi were ready to eat.

The city was smelly, hot. People love it. They couldn’t find the right employees, the right girls or boys; so they put ad out of their windows to find the right small fish in the ocean.

Giant like me found it hard to look for anything in these wardrobes.

Six o’clock in the morning. Already buses had been filled with people. Cars still not started. No dogs, no camera, no smoking, no…were signed outside McDonald’s. H&M was shinning last night. Starbucks not opened yet. Pizza hut not opened yet. Kentucky Fried Chicken prepared 17 porridges and 24 soybean milks for its early opening. Hubs of shopping food and cloths, transport could be expensive. A young man behaved like in the ad, pushed the restaurant’s door. Waves of new dishes came out. Cars for sale at the airport waiting hall. Walmart had about 200 employees per shop while the fried chicken shop had about 20. They provided low skill, minimum wage jobs to the right people. Tiny shops could turn to extremely huge in China: everyone said there were gold here. Walmart’s chicken had been deep-fried, buns had been steamed and even, cooled. Well- facilitated kitchens in Walmart had everything that could be turned to food. And they were clean, extremely.

Vegetables had been washed and sent to cities, with other goods arriving too.

Cities were heavy, metal made, harmful, expensive and friendly in a way.

“I hate summer,” when it was 6:30, kids went to school, one of them said. I used to kind of like it. Considering all the sweat I have shed in summer for baking, bottled water and Zbrush, I hate it, too. Kid, I agree with you.

Finally, I realized there was a wine shop. It sold plum wine once The times was using as a gift. I lusted for its manager who looked like steward in Crouching and hidden. Time, give it time. It solved every shit things of my readership.

That was the exit.

Seven o’clock in the morning,  I boarded on a train from Bristol to London. It was 80 GBP. I thought I might need another week or two in London. The trains ran for two hours. Then I switched to the tube. In the morning, young miserable look thin man was cleaning windows of coffee shop in the winter. The landlord escorted me to the ATM machine. Then I quitted the idea of renting their house.

Eight o’clock, young chefs had their lazy breakfast, young students in school had their late breakfast, then rushed to classrooms for the fucking sleepy math class.

Nine o’clock in the morning, a job interview began. Ok, I left home at six.

Ten o’clock in the morning, morning shows stop. Restaurants began to prepare for the lunch. It could be very busy. Chinese chefs need to pre cook everything needed so they could shorten the time for every dish. Guys who had been on night switch should be feeling sleepy now.

Eleven o’clock. High school’s third class in the morning nearly ended. While, in university in China, it means lunch time started.

Twelve o’clock. Staff on trains began to sell over-priced food. They would say “which customer needs food? which customer needs food?” as if it was not lunch time.

One o’clock in the afternoon. It could be very hot on streets. Sweating.  Drops of water from air conditioners. Hot. Hot. You won’t think to buy a hot baozi now.

Two o’clock in the afternoon. Sara began her long sleepy lectures. Hidden behind monitors, sitting at a corner of a newsroom, I had to record everything she said.

Three o’clock in the afternoon. It could be not that hot. Everyone was thinking, hey, two hours to go.

Four o’clock in the afternoon. After a day of boring standing there, our wine shop finally began to have customers. Ten to nine.  Lots of people rushed to banks before their closure.

Five o’clock in the afternoon. Traffic.

Six o’clock in the afternoon. Teachers asked students’ parents to come to school to have a chat on some problems. Some students were still sweeping the classrooms. Night was approaching.

Seven o’clock in the afternoon. Classic China Central TV News.

Eight o’clock in the evening. TV drama. Kids crying. Washing machine.

Nine o’clock in the evening. People in service began to hate customers.

Ten o’clock in the evening. Night clubs began. Drinks, shouting.

Eleven o’clock in the evening. At the end of the day. Counting. Counting the money in your purse.

Twelve o’clock in the evening. Always began to forget to look at the watch… already passed midnight.

One. You could breathe.

Two. You could be unconscious and careless in the dream.

Three. You could fall, cry, laugh, mock, wash away all the masks. And another day of laboring and pushed, dragged, mentored… came.
And, some guys never slept during nights.

The good

This is a lesbian story.

When we went to grade seven, books began to have fewer pictures and they were in black and white. This story is meant to give grade seven to grade nine students a lesson to tell them what lesbian is.

Susan Perkin is a lesbian. She lives with her girlfriend who is a nurse in a health check center. Susan Perkin is owner of a coffee shop and a photo studio.

https://allenneptune.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/2014peanutsmovie_press_191114.jpg?w=300&h=200

One day she found herself got cancer. She had to shave herself bold to get the treatment. Her girlfriend is boyish and has many boys like her. She is straight, rude, short, black skin and beautiful. Her hair just reaches her shoulder.

Susan Perkin is also short. Her hair was cut short. She was awarded with several photo contest prize. A can of Coke is twenty in her coffee shop, which means the carefully arranged decoration (a bike on the wall), the clean and no smell toilets, the space, the facilities are stylish.

A couple of gay men wanted to open a bar nearby in this district near the Big tower where Chinese used to store books from India back to 700 AD. While, as my friend Joe moved into this district, I don’t think home owners would like to pay a visit to beer drinking and gay men dancing.

I was in a wine store for a day. Rich guys with oil money opened the shop for tea and wine. They played majiang and smoked all day long. Lots of meat with bones could be found in staff meal. They even had a chef and a very big stove. Only three staff shared a big bowl of meat— and one of them was a female saying she was intending to not eat, the other two were hungry college graduates.

I like rich guys. They make life brighter with their fancy four by fours and Gucci purses.

Summer is not hot to death. It was sunshine everywhere. Girls made their lips so red. When you look it twice, everything is a lie. Hidden behind food and clothing is called not suitable to be viewed. Shops close down quickly. Girls are ugly.

Just finished her travel to Japan, Susan Perkin received a resignation letter. Big Mac was shining in cold cold air conditioning but clients were not that many as it supposed to be to meet the rent.

I know you guys may rub yourselves at this early age. You may find sexual intercourse attractive and exciting. Men donate sperm into women’s worm then they got you guys. Sometimes, they do this not for making children purpose. So, that’s why same sex guys could have sex.

Doctors in the health check center see penises and genitals every day. They give them a quick look, then make a stamp on the paper to show pass or not.

Susan Perkin and her girlfriend were living in a neighborhood where gay men were singing together. They were in the club. Pretending to be someone’s wife is not a secret. When one man needs to get married to pass the thirty years old age when everyone elder wants you to be married, a lesbian could be found.

People in service are fucking hot in this district. People with best looking just pour in. Susan has married to a gay doctor, and her girlfriend has married to a gay seller. Things became complicated. By law, they could share properties and when divorce come, they should separate properties unless the marriage certificates are fake too.

Susan Perkin was dying. Cancer is curable but she died quickly. Then the shop was left to her girlfriend who had been relaxed, used to chatting all day long in the shit job. She quitted her job in the health center, focused on the café and photo business which she barely knew of.

The gay seller was an alcoholic addicted and bio sexual, once raped the slim girl. He was strong and big. She sang a lot. A lesbian from Singapore wanted to sleep with her and take her to Singapore. She refused.

Every night at twelve, Susan Perkin would appear. People say if the dead had something they miss very much, or things they could not forget, they would show up in the old house. Susan Perkin wanted to punish a girl who told her parents that she was a lesbian, which led directly to her separation with her parents.

That girl was the one in my one day wine shop experience, who said she didn’t want to eat.

Just 200 meters, the wine shop and the coffee shop had two guys who never see eye to eye.

Susan Perkin’s girlfriend attacked the wine shop girl one night. They were fighting each other using their teeth and nails. The gay doctor was returning home. Seeing this scene, he stopped them. Then they made a deal, transformed the coffee shop into a bar, the two professional sellers shoot off every day to get customers for the studio. They lived happy after forever.

Lesbian is les bian, which means the good.

### EAT, DRINK, MAN, WOMAN 1994 REVIEW
Posted by allenneptune on 05/06/2018

Eat, drink, man, woman 1994 Review

I am not really a big fan of pop singers. For writing’s purpose and to grab the end of my youth, I chose to claim I had been a fan of three silly girls. As age grows, I felt old and father like, esp. towards young women. And I might be the fan of the young girls, spoiling them and with no sensible thoughts just because they are the youngest.

It’s about friendship and three layers of voices. Though woman always don’t have true female friends after marriage, women are always helping themselves in their own ways of socializing and empowering. I don’t think I could manage woman’s stories as these male Chinese directors did in the 90s. Why could they see the world through women’s eyes.

But at least I could be a fan. Silly, shallow, simple, S.H.E., the Taiwanese pop band of three female singers, had one album after another. Quickly they had lots of fans and became as popular as other best selling Taiwanese singers in Chinese world.

Ang Lee’s films had been uneasy to understand for me. This movie is esp. lovely by people as its topic is shallow, simple and silly. The widowed man was a Chinese cuisine master and had been thinking, oh, just have sex again until my girls have married themselves. He must have been very sick and unsatisfied with his sex life. This movie is all about his hunger. The same thing happened to the elder daughter who had been dreaming in a poor country through Taiwan’s economy was booming. The smartest one of the three was a business woman in sales, who finally got nothing actually. Seen as a Herr of her father’s tricky skills and whole Chinese classic culture, she was beautiful. The youngest married herself earliest, just as Jane Austen had written. Could we say the whole family were silly as none of them was in the right path regarding to marriage and sex life.

Well, as a movie lover, I had the feeling that the director had been used to things needing lots of steps to make, which is advanced level or difficult in recipes. The band has faded out from our adult life and I have missed the years of being a crazy teenager fan. One night, I was in a KFC and a teenager girl was just sitting there after attending a concert. They, I mean the teenagers, were easy going and she had a little chat with me about her idol. Healthy, sunshine, harmless, these idols should be very careful with their public figures.

### 寻枪 一
Posted by allenneptune on 29/04/2018

（11970 字）

单位的小刘丢了一把枪。

土耳其。

深夜。重案六组的季洁和几个中年男子带着小李在光秃秃的山上转悠。黑糊糊的画面上只有三辆车的大灯顺着公路。海浪拍着光秃秃的山。季洁开始抱怨她儿子在美国上学的跟不上。季洁讲：你说那个汤唯吧，拍了个大色情片成名了。我和她配戏就出了那么几场。哎呀呀。咱们这些规矩的人怎么活。重案六组里那个秃头讲：说了我们不是搞艺术的，人家那才是，艺术。

车停了，大灯开着。季洁把小李扭下车，转了几个圈。两个人消失在了海边的草里。

海风呼呼地。一辆火车从远景的上方驶过。这是个很荒凉的地方，属于火车上看哪种没有几户人家的山区。火车上的人往这边看就看见几个车灯，像极了山西陕西交接的那些夜里没有几处灯的地方。火车上的人纳闷，这么晚在荒野做什么。这边的警察讲，老子执行公务，祝你娘火车开海里，生娃没屁眼，乱管闲事。

小刘的老朋友小李多年没有联系了。小李喜欢的女孩在加拿大，小李执意要跟过去。就像电影金玉满堂中的那样。小李有很多同学是武警，有一部分是负责机场检查签证出关的，所以没有钱的小李不用签证出关还是有那么万分之一的可能性的。

在深山里，假设有这么一个地方，村落的村户七零八落的，为了防身，为了糊口，这么一户人家有一把枪。农村的院落不是很安全。如果身上有把刀子，会不会感觉到更安全。在英国留学的时候小李身上有一阵带着一把厨刀，英国交通工具没有安检，这把刀跟了小李很久，试听从新华社记者意见带的。其实利兹治安不好，英格兰人民性格暴虐，不是说别的地方治安就不好。农村的确是有枪的。在土耳其与乔雅咖啡国交界处，人们怎么能说第二次世界大战后旧的贸易道路封锁本国人民就没有咖啡喝了呢？这个地方房屋都是木头建造的，也近海。地处偏僻，物资匮乏。

农村很苦的，一碗方便面都是哄小孩的好食品。买个东西要走很长时间。城市的垃圾又总是漂到农村，山不清水也不秀什么都不方便。这样一个地方藏一把枪是很方便的。看到三鲜伊面包装上的那只鸡，打只麻雀也算。

小刘心里捣鼓，这个小李喜欢的女孩也是自己多年前的朋友，大家好久好久没有联系了，怎么就突然喜欢了。莫非小李有其他难言之隐不得不去加拿大。才看了地图，发林海雪原是加拿大的情况。都说只有周杰伦才有闲钱移民加拿大，就是的。两岸一旦开打，杰伦不是住的地方都没有了，他的公司肯定是租的房产。小李一直以为加拿大是林海雪原，加拿大和俄罗斯的不同之处是加拿大北边不住人，俄罗斯北边住人，还冬泳。冰原太阳很低的加拿大是没有人住的荒原，但是更像俄罗斯，这样低的太阳还能在秘鲁和伊朗看到，长长的影子。黑土地的肥沃更像是东北。加拿大的耕地是林地凯耕，集中在东南部。

这样维度的国家好像在漠河看北极光。

中国像一艘宇宙飞船似地加速飞行着。

时间很紧了。长得很帅的执行组长大叔不得不加紧时间昼夜办案。没有办法面对国外媒体的质疑。曹林讲，防火防盗防记者。国内记者一般不会关心这种案件的。国外的法院门前都站满了记者。省电视台不得不派了一个摄影老师全程跟踪。

穿着警服的有两个人，一个是执行组长，一个是差点去当保安又叫了回来的办事员。警服后面没有什么明显字样，远看去还以为是街上维持交通的协警或是保安。季洁从后面的阴影里闪出来。说：草这小子糊弄我们。到了地方又说想不起来了。小李和小马同时被捕。小马给小李背了个黑锅。小马说：我记得是个圆形树冠的树。这边的树都是长的。

在无声无息的宇宙里，曾今吃牛肉和牛奶长大的欧美人和曾今吃三鲜伊面长大的中国人，在拼比着财力，实力，国际影响力。如果没有对所在群体的贡献，很难被称作一个人，失业的人像一个废弃的零件，死去的宇航员，没用的船员，被扔进海里便是了。

在英国教堂的周天有免费的晚餐吃。大概有基金会管街上的流浪人员，这样还是有人在街上住。在中国有救助中心，不过报道很恐怖的样子。在厦门，在上海都能看到。虽然现在富了，但是有人吃住在流动厕所，西安厦门福州都能看到，之前还有报道讲有人家买了厕所改来住。还是挺恐怖的。去约旦的时候，见到大大的太阳下的垃圾桶有孩子在捡垃圾，觉得唉，钱这么值钱的国家孩子也这么可怜。相反，看钱同样值钱的古巴街上就很干净。

马路边上，会有赶路的人。我们称之为赶路，的确是在很古风地坐11路。无声无息地，他走向暗黑宇宙地深处。服务员在客人找茬的时候，经理会讲，没事，十年以后没人知道你在这里，你是谁，你曾经做过什么。没人会问你有多少钱，你像一个坏掉的零件，从这个大大大大的宇宙飞船上掉了下来，就再也找不到了。

最清楚的莫过于清洁工了，银行自动取款机的早晨，清洁工叫醒流浪汉，流浪汉收拾起自己的行李，去别处晒太阳了。

看过电影最后三日的人都知道，离开一个国家有很多原因，不得以离开一个国家多是政治和法律原因扯不清又是大麻烦。

小李比较口拙，说话意思表达不清，辞不达意，搞不就要给别人画图解释。大学的时候还联络过，来小刘家玩，似乎有数不尽的苍凉要诉说，两个男的在带床的房间里讲话，好别扭。

我们国家的枪支在警队里，少数猎场也有枪，押钞的有枪，发令枪也算的话，私人是不允许有枪支的。电影寻枪里讲阳光照不到的黑暗里有枪，普通人要枪做什么。

防身? 坐火车的话一把菜刀都难得带上，怎么带武器自卫。要么就所有人没有武器，要么就所有人都有武器，钢铁是怎样炼成的中保尔偷了枪，也给自己带来了麻烦。小刘是做办公室的，身上不带枪。片警身上带枪吗，也不带。

想到这里时，单身的小刘被路边小朋友的喷水枪溅到。他刚关了车门，回到空荡荡的房间。

这把枪是前两天从莲花池市场买到的，想去山里打点野鸡兔子小鹿，过下十八世纪英国人的生活。乾隆也有自己的猎场哦，电影巴莱克什么的真是刀刀见血，也是有自己的猎场的。小刘没事看资治通鉴，史记，是很有古风的一个青年。何况是西安人，带着匈奴的血。小刘想去打猎，多半是因为在他和小李均认为，男大当打猎，猎味最新鲜。这是件很原始的事情。男人是因为打猎而活着的。在他和小李心里，有那么一点流浪的，荒野的，气质。自由的，不负责任的，抛弃妻儿的躲避。

德国，加拿大，美国都是可以申请狩猎许可证的。国内可能不行。这么一点昂贵的特权，小刘想拥有，而且不想昂贵地出国去拥有。

忽略掉所有地合法申请程序，小刘给自己搞了一把，就像在美国买把枪那样。传说中芝加哥的枪战…… 小李不明白，有了战争，天灾时，人们会躲避，国内没有战争，没有天灾，钢筋混凝土不会无故砸下来砸死人；小李觉得这些高层实在是从香港传来的烂东西，因为高层就能在一片地皮上赚更多的钱，而且香港不会地震，而国内很多地方如此高层如此密集塞人进去，地震来了砸到了就人口减少了。其实有句最近很流行的新口号也大概是从香港传来的，小李有个在香港做律师的朋友很早以前这么说过。报纸上对着香港大加赞美，在深圳的时候望那边，海风里有臭味，夜色里那面的确繁华像金子在对着黑夜闪光，但是更有点妇人的气质，是很上海的。

同行三辆车。摄影记者和边境解放军做一辆车。季洁，警长和公诉大人在一辆车。挖掘的两个人一辆车。小马问司机要一根烟，司机正点着，被警长制止了。警长说：做事的人才给烟吃，你做了什么事，一晚上糊弄我们。

小马刚被季洁拳打脚踢的一顿。三辆车停在海边的野地里。解放军先生说我都算着公里数呢。季洁讲哦你算得清哦，不想跟着来被领导派来的。解放军先生讲要不要吃小食品，我在加油站带的。季洁讲有没有畅轻啊。

季洁在另一个暗处撒了泡尿，一个闪电，山石上的一个题字什么摩崖。很快雨下了起来。

如此议论，还是要写穷人的生活。穷人啊，就是交不到女朋友的人。就是陈奕迅别给我ICE TEA那首，女孩来到住处，家徒四壁。

很单纯的想法，开车去打猎。这是一把手枪。不坐公交没人会查。

偷窃的人多不是因为需要而偷窃，而是因为一直没有被发现而偷窃。私自拥有一把枪，就像洗碗阿姨辞职前拿了餐厅的很多盘子。

但是枪声是敏感的，想象一下发令枪响的时候，身体所有部位都不知所措，生怕自己被击中。车开到了江油，九寨沟，甚至汉中，并不是特别偏僻的地方，山里几声枪响，并不是投进水中的石头就此沉下没有后文了。

小李最近离小刘很近。小李一直没有工作，所以小刘出去打猎的时候会经常带着小李。一是犯罪现场需要同伙，二是小李口风紧，三是聊聊女孩的事，两个人都是大龄单身汉。

冰原上，只有安静和风速。小李和小刘盖了一栋木头房子。芝加哥有零下三十五度。加拿大的冰原上，小刘和小李拿出冷冻食品，开始油炸。两人喝着小酒。芝华士，男人的冰钓。

枪在一个度假山庄丢了。小刘用枪对着小李，因为小李悔了棋，又讽刺了小刘奋进公务员序列的动机。小李说您别，我还要去加拿大的。于是小刘把枪放到了自己的皮包里，继续下棋。这个度假山村是旧时的疗养院，面对着黑海，人们在这里做足疗。很多旧时的病人在苏联崩溃之后都没人管了，医院医生不得不自己掏腰包支持他们，可是医院也要倒闭了。

司机师傅给小马洗了脸上的血迹。长长树冠的树旁有棵苹果树。调皮的摄影老师知道夜里没得拍，吸着烟，和司机和公诉人聊起来。三个男人开始聊自己的生活。公诉人讲自己老婆死的早，死之前还说明了自己死亡的时间。这是一个很小的国家，地处内陆，和福建大小。周围的国家在打仗。

海风里，公诉人讲这种省城小地方不适合女人发展。

车灯照射范围内有棵苹果树。有人用手拽了下长着苹果的树枝。苹果掉了下来。半红半绿。树下有一条小河，很小很小。半红半绿的苹果顺着水流流到一个拐角，走不动了。拐角处有一个已经变质的苹果也躺在那里。要是没有外媒的压力，谁会去管这些烂掉的苹果。

遥远的海王星，离太阳最远，这样的地方，适合放逐和流浪，或者做永恒的太阳系卫士。

下雨了，众人上了车。季洁在后面坐着，有点困倦了。秃头的办事员开始讲案件。观众才明白这些的确是在办案的。同所的小刘失踪了很久，已经确定是死了。两个疑犯在被押着找尸体。大家嚷着要休息。司机说去麦当劳吧，晚上在麦当劳过，一人两百块吃过。警长说你要死了啊，去星巴克，五星级停车点还有个星巴克，一人一杯咖啡一个二十块以内的点心。他补充了一句，说那个姓马的没有份。

季洁说住店。说困了要睡觉明天没法搞的。办事员说那去我们大酒店吧。于是给保安长打了电话，几个车夜里冲进大酒店，开了栋能做饭的别墅。

枪详细的讲，是在度假山庄的酒吧丢的。度假山庄里有些省城的贵客，所以准备了些货真价实的洋酒。两人喝着咖啡，闲聊着一些小刘办案时的趣闻，吃着前一天打回来的小野鸡炖茶树菇，烧鹿筋，烤兔子头。餐厅的服务员把茶水倒上后，也把小刘的皮包搜过了，枪就这么不见了。森林里充满了动物和坚果，没有森林就意味着失去了陆上的吃的。虽然森林里充满了蛇，还有其他的大小动物，猪，鹿，大象。柬埔寨的鹿也是保护的，意大利人吃兔子，可能没有意识到动物的价值比吃掉本身会更高。

小刘发现后就毛了。好像自己的配枪丢了。但他又冷静下来，希望没有痕迹就好像自己没有枪一样。小李讲，我去加拿大肯定不是旅游签证，其实可以旅游一下脱团的变黑工的。他讲他不想那么样子。小刘说那可要七八年五六千万的，你能等吗。小李讲等锥子啊，我现在失业啊，我连房子都没有啊。小六讲哎呀那你要怎么办，彩票都没有那么大的奖。小李讲，你都有私枪了，我觉得混进加拿大可能也是和从餐厅拿个盘子一样简单。小刘讲那你那个盘子可得是国宝级的盘子，卖掉拿到钱，也不能等移民局给名额，要直接去贿赂拿身份，价格一样时间省了，好多办户口的都是这么搞的。

小李申请了布里斯托大学考古系的硕士。国家很给面子还弄了个交流项目，学费省了。小李是政法大学毕业的，不是北京大学。小李即使博士读出来了，有很难拿到学校的工作来支持自己的打猎生活。

小刘和小李还有个朋友叫小马。小马是高科技人员，属于极端武装牙齿的高精尖人员，就是比医生更那么精尖又重要人们又不得不花钱。小马有个朋友叫保罗。保罗在国内官做得很高了。平成四年，第一大太监篡夺皇位，扶持脑白金夫妇东征西战，简直是亚洲的拿破仑，霸占了俄国从芬兰到美国的两条铁路线。人们都奇怪太监做皇帝没有子嗣怎么办。

犯罪和贫穷的联系，一般人都会认为贫穷必犯罪。著名警探李琩钰估计也是这么想的，他的网络直播是收钱的，所有的大的科技公司的网络直播都是免费的。在警察眼里，加上所有的保安和看门狗，都会认为如果有了警棍，所有的过路人都是要硬闯机关大楼和私人宅邸的。仔细想想，这不是出于职位的负责，而是因为被赋予了什么魔法，就觉得可以修理别人。这是不很平等的。

这样写很不负责任。很多地方没有去过，没有办法写。很多人没有接触过，都是为了行文需要。但是读者看到了，尤其是青少年读者看报纸杂志，很容易被作者的语言文风和态度全部接受。特别是对于公众人物，基本上批评就是可以不负责任的。

如果没有遗产，家庭破碎，生活环境又很不在阳光下，是怎样的花朵怎样用心也很难培育成的。这时候需要一种秩序，一种逃离，一个保障，在公务员眼里，体制内望社会，就是从乱七八糟分离出来，终于上了岸。生活会像宫里的奴才那样按时按点。

小李就这样看不起小刘考入警察序列。乱七八糟，很丑陋很真实像个破掉的衣服上又镶满了珠子，否则县城里怎么都是上市企业。小李明白自己在这些洞洞里，小刘是那个穿着这件衣服的人。

小李讲，这个盘子在哪里，历史博物馆仓库吗？

大太监原先是中科院的。那是十年前的事了。小李才十九岁。十九岁的时候，小李拥有小野鸡般柔嫩的皮肤，面部肌肤吹弹可破。眼角也没有皱纹，虽然不洗脸不刷牙，但集体生活中还是又欧莱雅起码是香皂的每早滋润的。见过航天一中的中学生做中巴车上学吗，不是上海地铁里那种消费很高的中学生，是很纯的很纯的。这是一个让人心动的年纪。

十九岁，刚刚过性侵犯的定义。如果上帝在云端望着我们，他一定早让我们去死了。所以英格兰教堂大主教就讲，有时候我也感觉上帝睡着了。这么天价的房子，这么高的物价，这么紧张的节奏，其实什么都是新的，有点没有着陆摸不到。

如果上帝在云端看我们，他一定会给我们提示的。事实是，如果上帝要将大人于你啊，他必然会让你吃不消受尽苦头，然后站起来才是英雄。这是一个多么儒家的孟子的原话的套用啊。上帝其实在智利南端的山区里。当地人称山里的风速是上帝的怒吼。冰与火，完全不适合人类生存的贫瘠之地。生物却在这刀刃一样恶劣的环境中生存着。

小李觉得住在四季酒店才能听到城市澎湃的松涛，小刘觉得开着汽车才能体会福特的活得精彩，小马觉得女人的阴部是天堂的音乐，保罗觉得云端的感觉就是特效做得很好了。

这样的艺术是昂贵的。要欧洲的米开罗吉朗，达芬奇，罗丹，那菲尔，要日本的横平竖直古建筑。这样的逃离生活，这样在失业中十年一觉电影梦，我把青春献给你，屏风看海，是没有金熊奖不能平息民怒的。

一夜情却是便宜的，随处可得的。不远处便是酒店，觉得酒店脏，就在自家约小朋友。大太监那时还啃着今麦郎，请客吃饭还要用券，所有的性生活和生活的压力要在小野鸡身上发泄。那时候神并不远，西单就有海淀也有。纲常伦理，在就没了。礼坏乐崩，是一种很宇宙的未来感。

夜里面，所有的小厨师大厨师又被叫醒，羊腿，野菜，三文鱼全部招待办案人员。餐厅的经理被保安头子喝来叫去，像个文静乖巧的姑娘准备着餐后甜点。突然停电了。黑暗里不知谁摸了谁一把，谁大喊大叫了一阵。

小马被折腾了一天，也吃到了，现在被无限善解人意又美丽的餐厅经理一服务，无比感动留下了泪水。观众都认为那是忏悔的泪水，嫉恶如仇。

几个人出门抽了烟，三三两两私聊去了。公诉人和季洁聊了起来。季洁讲，你老婆死了都不尸检，怎么会说什么时候死就什么时候死。公诉人讲，生过娃就死了，当场。季洁讲，有一种药可以做到的，你只不过不想相信她会自杀。公诉人讲：我觉得我被原谅了，没想到关于我的外遇她怨念这么久。季洁讲是啊，你长得像杨朔似的，都以为你是美国演员呢。

小刘讲，这个枪是哪里来的？

小李讲，你那枪不是刚丢了吗，丢了你都不敢声张？

小刘讲，机场不时就有偷渡的，你偷渡好了，美国要60万，加拿大会便宜一些的。

小李讲，那是人贩子啊白痴，看过贾森斯坦里的电影吗，人贩子集装箱运人到欧洲啊。

小刘讲，一分钱一分货，收钱不办事不是道上的规矩。

小李讲，可别走黑啊，完全是没有消费者权益啊。我租了个房子，房东看着是黑过的，支付宝提醒我说对方账户异常，我当时想黑一下吧，于是就后悔不已房子问题百出押金不退。还是走正规机构吧。 

小刘讲，no pain，no gain。 你这么穷，不冒一下生命危险。

小李讲，你当我是股票啊，高风险高回报。

小李把枪在自己的皮鞋里调整了一下。他不明白自己为什么要这把枪。他觉得这个枪转手价钱不会低。半路上，他犹豫了下，杀死了小刘，把他的车也转手了。车带枪总共进账四万块。这样出了人命，国内是不能呆了。他没有护照，也不能出国。小李没有住处，他唯一的选择就是找人帮忙，不是住房局的问题，是国土资源的问题。

这是一种一个人丢失所有，在荒野里独自面对世界的苍凉。冷，冷到没有知觉，过去的错误就记不得了。原来他们都可以成为人的，现在却都是半人半鬼的状态。回不到故土，在雪原上伶仃。夜里像狼一样嚎叫着，痛哭着男人的心事。以前他们是有正道走的，只是礼坏乐崩，乱世罢了。三个男人在教堂里读着经文，仿佛找到了什么，放佛读了以后就不再是少数族裔外地人了。 

小刘也想在公路边开一块山石，出一片空地，建一座自己的三四层楼。问题是他没有那么多钱。小李知道很多人在打工做生意赚这份钱，他在建筑科技大学学的是历史建筑复原，他很敬佩古人用木头造房子的灰飞烟灭的不用爆破的方便于拆除。

这片空地，是所有的一切的值得守卫的，绝对不能失去的，所有的来源与归去。国家是最终的土地拥有者是件好事也是件坏事，具体的他们两个太年轻，讲不出更多。

每个人都想去对方的心里看一看，对方有时候给自己的小心灵断了网，就像一座绿岛那样横在福建对岸。倒过来看山山水水时，感觉所有的山石都浮起来了，水又飘在天空应有的位置，像东北的天那样低那样沉郁。其实我们的心是无极中的那个王宫，有十几层故宫似的红墙金瓦同心圆。那个小星球，只有自己的冰原看日出，太阳很低，影子很长，是一片空地，很农民的感觉。中国海水是黄的，少年派里海水是蓝的，有的海岸是沙滩，有的海岸是礁石，这池子水和这球形体的空气都是会挂沙暴的，人们真的应该移民到海里。深海里有的鱼根本没有视觉的，在某个国家的岩洞里，藏着很多淡水，这里的鱼也没有视觉。是非洲吗？

四万块，警察还没有来找他，多半是因为小刘刚调休。小李把自己的资料整理了下，四万块跑到了喀什，搞到了什么出入证，出了境。莫欺少年穷，有秩序还是比没秩序好，但是，乱世出枭雄啊。他显然是去不了加拿大了。 

他得到了一件宝贝，叫波斯王子的时间砂。

砂子只会发生作用，如果使用者是为了拯救世界不会被毁灭。

私人的打算，自己的想法，不能实现，是不是因为自己没有一颗拯救世界的心呢？先是拯救世界，再是安稳生活。技术和持久战，对于小小的穷光蛋小李，拯救世界也好，逃到桃花源也好，路远且艰难。

时间倒流了，他回到了大学毕业前的那个晚上。他选择不出国了，他选择去上火星时代的一万块的班，然后开始上班。拯救世界，他必须从此开始拯救世界不被沙暴掀翻，简单的讲就是北京从此没有沙尘暴。否则，他会再次走上杀人逃逸的路。

第二天，所有队员全血复活。昨夜就喊着睡觉的季洁没睡，和警长二人审了小马很久，最后怎么反而被小马感动了。给了他一支烟。

车走在阴天的山间，又回到了另一个野地里。一直狗叫了叫，把一个人头从土中抛了出来。昨天的雨下了一半，出了山就不下了。这片野地也是干的。挖坟的把尸体挖出来，发现五花大绑了。就是小刘的尸体。季洁和警长二人企图私用职权，痛扁小马第二次。季洁骂着：你这是个野兽啊。野兽派艺术家呀。人搞死了就算了，还要五花大绑搞死。警长道：枪呢，那支枪呢，为什么是射人的鸡巴。两人被拉住了。

爱尔兰充满了林子。林子里动物不多的样子。这样一个备受侵略的地方，人们并没有变成绿林英雄，而是移民了。

摄影大哥开始录像。公诉人说：观众朋友们，我们现在是在某省和谋省的交界处，更接近某省，死者，刘某某，尸体被发现。尸体完好，小便处有枪伤。手臂和脚被绑在背后。现在工作人员正在解除这些绳子。现场条件条件所限，不能进一步进行尸检。尸体现在被移送到国家医院。

小马嘟囔了一句他搞我老婆。

看着天上的枯掉的树木，冬天的漫长，如同一个助学贷款，在无尽的打工中，在低技能的工作中，在两三年农场林场的劳作中，累了就睡在田里，又因为做着很低贱的工作，负担不起昂贵的食物，交不到朋友，被人讨厌。这片枯掉的树，是最坏的，最坏的感觉，做了所有的努力还是不被认可。而最终，我们结束漂流，找到自己的安心之处，玩着开心农场的时候，青春已经不在了。小李认为的三十而立，其实就是三十而凑乎。您凑乎凑乎吧，这个十年啊，如此地动荡让人生厌。偷走的时间，空空如也，贫穷，贫穷，还是贫穷，不负责任的父辈们，温柔地藏匿了不怎么安全的贫穷和犯罪里唯一又安全感的枪，只留下了无力的年轻人一座空地和不见尸首的祖祖辈辈。

那个服务员真的是微笑着，趁小李不注意，收走了他睡觉都放在枕头下的刀。

后话。

“我以前是好过的，也试图更好，这是一个金子的时代，这是一个赶超的时代，这是一个炫耀的时代，不允许你没有人没有物没有正确的方向。‘’

“你值得拥有。“

尸体在医院迎接尸检，小马被枪毙。小李不知下文。季洁尸检的时候发现小刘呼吸道有土，是被活埋的。 这个案件没人管了。外媒追踪了一阵，某国警察私配猎枪反被杀。 

加拿大的雪啊，真够藏污纳垢的，小李感叹了下，不留痕迹地被释放了。

谁能说自己内裤上没有一坨屎呢。

刚吃了麦当劳。麦当劳就是所有本地传统餐厅的敌人。我很怀疑脸书创始人在意大利旅行吃麦当劳是不是作秀，因为人们到了意大利是不会在去傻逼兮兮的麦当劳，至少我不会。但今天我理解了这件事。我在闽南，我认为比闽北的菜要好吃一千倍，难做，讲究一千倍，结果上街什么都没敢吃，也没见到大馆子，连聚春园都没有，全是四川菜，东北菜如此，我的天啊，这是闽南啊，不是北京上海深圳啊。日。只好滚进麦当劳。事实证明这的确是又一个全国傻逼聚集地。这个福建的文化还是在福州，这他妈闽南没文化。 

宾馆倒是大了一倍。两年前是106吧。我不是很喜欢麦当劳啦。完全偏离这个小说的气氛了。厦门嘛。远华案。加拿大藏污纳垢的典型。我觉得小李应该已经完全明白了这个国家的房价，物价和这个国家自由之名下的各种问题。

这个事情需要在国外居住，长期或短期。

乔纳森海客儿是一个律师，刚刚结婚。他最近接到一个邀请，要从英国去东欧某国一趟。 他去了，当地人们都很恐惧这个他要去的地方。

这是一个城堡。去城堡的路上有狼。接待他的是发邀请的那个人。终于，他发现这是一个空的城堡，这个发邀请的人光线下没有影子，镜子里没有反光。律师没有办法脱身只好应付。

向发邀请的人解释了所有他要知道的法律事情后，律师被放走了。这个鬼运送自己和自己的棺材到了英国。他在英国有几处房产。

怪事情开始发生。律师的朋友露西死了。死了以后又夜里攻击婴儿。律师的几个好友在一位荷兰律师的指点下，明白了对手的弱点，把这个鬼赶出了英国。 

他们追击这个鬼，最终追击到了他的城堡。

这是一个没有阳光的叙述。黑暗的房间只有烟灰缸，电脑的屏幕和很多书籍纸张。还好房间在某大楼顶层，很大，有落地玻璃窗，像一个新的火车站那样半圆形的玻璃墙，很安静。窗外是纽约。

博士要回国了。博士的博士还没有读完，听说在多伦多大学学习的博士有延期读不出来的，博士这个博士论文就菊花相当紧了。

三年过去了，这是多么大一篇论文啊。家乡的老人每月都给自己寄地方志过来，让他不能忘记自己是中国人。这是容易忘记自己国籍的地方，是的，这是。他学的是古典文学，西方古典文化。西方人都不一定会学的专业。他最喜欢的作者是美国一个写侦探小说的。

回国是花费很多的。机票，礼品，幸好他不是同性恋，否则是肯定不愿意回国了。思乡吗？是的，这里买不到孜然。就是有时间，有闲钱，突然想回国一趟。机票买了下周的，无疑很贵，礼品去高档商店买了很多衣服。两年没有回国了，孤独。毒品，性乱，枪战，每天都像一部低俗小说。他很幸运这些低俗没有烧到自己这个楼顶。唯一抵抗的，他有抵抗吗？他难道没有在拥抱这些吗,他根本不介意别人用毒品，他自己就性乱，他倒是没见过枪。他嫖过。

他不想念家乡的食品，他有点喘不过气，身体不适，感觉自己可能不适应这么多烤的的东西，总有点上火。特别是，不适应这样自由自在无拘无束无人理会。在国外独居很可怕的。

夜很长。纽约很冷。他看着要过年了，又在网上订了张火车票。事实是他的论文卡住了。他才不想趁着春运。第一次出国，时间有点久了。上一次只是在香港开了会，不算回国。

他下楼，走过十几条街，到一家福州小吃店。他不在外面吃饭的，每天花两小时做饭。他要了一碗猪肝面。那个碗是沃尔玛的十几美元一个。一个打扮像李宇春的女孩在窗边，窗外一个打扮奇异的男的把一张带着女孩头像的纸砸在窗上，对了名字，两人离开了。

他要付钱，发现钱包丢了。一个人拿着他的钱包正往门外走。里面有所有的证件，shit。

博士追出三条街，那人滑入地铁站的厕所，又从厕所冲出来把博士撞倒，消失在人海里。没钱，没钥匙。没证件，谁叫您把所有的essential都装在一个gap买的钱包里。这时博士穿着一双阿迪，篮球短裤，一个夹克，一件毛衣，给房东打电话。电话没电了像一块砖头，没带充电器。shit，今晚去哪里。

他被操控了。平日都不在外面吃饭，夜里也绝不出门的。天机一动想来吃猪肝面就走了一个小时。孤独是孤独者的墓志铭。

他想起一个朋友，大概知道住址，不远，于是走过去敲门。没人应。他就坐在青苔的石阶上。这时门开了，一个亚裔男孩说再见出了门。他的朋友看到了他，表情复杂，博士进了门，意识到这位爱尔兰朋友在一个奇怪的情绪中还没换过来，就讲：你们公司的那个产品介绍我想再看一眼，突然有点思路。爱尔兰人讲：以为你只会写解说词呢。

博士就这样在一个周末的凌晨在别人家里蹭吃噌喝了一夜。

第二天，博士搭顺车到了警察局，银行，办理了临时证明，回国刚好补办护照。

在国外就多了一张牌。你可以对国内的种种不听不问。你甚至可以很刺激地浏览反动网站而不必自律。这样有不同的声音，很利于认识事情的全面。事情总有另一面。

两年没见面，快三年，人们彼此会生疏的。在国外又多了一张牌，在国外本身就是一张牌。不联系的人听说了这个还是会因为信息交流的缘故来见面的。没有人会选择被蒙蔽，看。

出国又意味着很有钱很成功。没有人会拒绝和有钱又成功的人做朋友。所以回国意味着很多的饭局。

第一顿饭是和一个在上海做地产的朋友。朋友讲自己在陆家嘴的楼前几年失了两百万，这两年正以每年一半的速度赚回来。是在一家叫铜锣湾的餐厅吃的饭，吃的却是浙江菜。同学其实是警察，松江大学城的片警，专管学校的。手上有几处房产，所以每日打牌也可以收租。两个人颇为夸张地在餐厅吹嘘着，散伙后博士感到无比害羞。

第二顿饭是和一个东北的同学吃的，大学时候的上下铺。同学抱怨着温州的房价已经涨到了两万一平方米。同学正在温州发展，准备买房子。很久很久很久没见面了。最后一次见面大概是毕业前一个月，最后一次吃饭都记不清了。很尴尬的见面，博士感觉同样在国内读博士的同学会抢了自己风头，很容易被比较，特别是在国内会更well connected。

第三顿是和那个寄地方志的老爷爷吃的。其实长大期间老爷爷一直不怎么来往关心的，现在被称为老朋友，实在是出于礼貌。老爷爷趁四下没人，说裤子脱了，小鸡鸡给我看看。博士只好顺从，装作自己无知，只是看老人家德高望重年龄大，也是对晚辈的一种爱。

这个年龄家里开始物色结婚了。一般是美国的博士配英国的博士。博士的妈妈给博士介绍了一个美国硕士，也在纽约，说怕读书寂寞。这家颇为开放，博士说慌了。博士一看照片，似曾相识的感觉。说，妈你太费心了。博士的母亲讲给你介绍一个同乡，要不你们两个人都会陪白人黑人乱睡觉的。博士说我找酒店的卡片的。博士的母亲说那能靠谱，比酒店客房还脏。博士说那样画面不会很好看，太文弱了。

父亲是政府官员，每年有很多机会出国和其他国家的省市政府交流。也去纽约看过博士。父亲讲你学的这个回来只能教书，还不是那种很热门的老师。早早准备，我认为你在国外找不到很技术岗位的工作的，因此，如果你和美国人情意绵绵，你是要隔绝之苦的。你除了写书做电视，工资不会很高，成功几率小，基底很厚但不见得会找到畅销的机会。

博士回答讲，你是靠政府吃饭的，你哪里懂赚钱的事。

如此，博士被一顿毒打。博士心里很希望父亲能陪自己多一点，更认可自己，但父亲对自己很冷漠，即使自己争取，也难见笑容。

家里有几亩良田种着水稻，水田里养着鲤鱼。博士坐在长满茶树的山丘上，风干着眼泪。没过一会春雨开始了，母亲熬了粥，青黄不接的春天来了，油盐炒了芽菜，水泥院子里有昏黄的灯和过年剩下的食品，自己伤心了一会，就忘记了。有一片土地，这是最生生不息的事。

博士有论文在身，很快回到了纽约。第一件事是大逛书店。国内机场火车站甚至没有一个书店，街上除了新华书店就是中小学教辅，一本对的书，是不会出现在旧书铺，不会出现在图书馆，网上或许能买到。但是，与其用亚马逊跨洋过海代购，还不如自己来逛书店。总会有对的书出现在一堆不对的书里。博士买了一本英国小说家在巴斯投店的小说，又买了一本英国诗人写的自传。在自传里能看到很多地方志。

这个母亲讲的美国硕士，那天丢钱包的晚上见到了。命运真是充满巧合。博士给他打了电话，说父母介绍最靠谱的。

见面在一家西班牙餐厅。博士是文弱的，硕士是长相平平的。这是一次无聊的中文交谈。交谈过后，两人均认为费城和纽约连接在了一起，从此可以有沙发睡了。两人都没有讨论对方的性生活，博士租的住处大，自然是大哥。对方读的是犯罪学。

过了三个月，博士给硕士送了手表，也把硕士送回国了。

父亲心脏出了问题。博士要捐心脏。

### 03 A YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAD NO PERSONAL LIFE.
### BANKRUPT MAN FOUND HIS FATHER A GAY.
### A SCHOOL TEACHER LOOKED AFTER HIS SICK WIFE.
### 05 YOUNG CHINESE FINANCIER’S REAL REASON OF DEATH REVEALED.

Billy Yin got very drunk after a dinner with some
friends. They told him he could drink like the Tianchi,
a glacier lake in Tianshan mountain. Actually, he
was high after two shots, and couldn’t sleep because
of vomiting and stomach ache after five shots. Hours
later, he found himself in the middle of desert and no
one was around.

He needed a bottle of Sprite as it was in the ad. He
wanted to jump into the sands like jumping into a
swimming pool. No, he found himself the clearest
moment in his life: he needed insurance and rescue
service from a fortune 500 company, might called
Allianz or something, French company.

He had nearly vomited all the things in his stomach
and things he tried to eat to balance the alcohol.
Grains could work but not more liquid. It was bitter, it
was from his body. He doubted if he could pass this all
by himself. It’s the side effects of drinking that made
him nearer to death, not the crime of throwing him
into the middle of dessert.

After hours of lying there communicating with stars,
one after another, he managed to sit straight. He
needed water. Then he needed a shelter. There was
no water in the middle of Chile’s south most mountain
region. There were pumas around in day break. They
were sleeping. He silently passed them without waking
up them. Winds were dry. Horses were running. It’s
hard to tame them. He was not far from a road and
with the road, there was a water tunnel like those you
could see in Beijing from Miyun dam with signs ‘no
swimming’.

He dared not to get any closer as from his experience
these tunnels could be deep and he could not swim.
Houses were abandoned. He got into one but, the
walls were damaged. Penguins moved into his sight,
one, two, three, thousands of them. They rubbed their
bellies with the sands.

Billy Yin was half robot so he thought he could survive
without food and if the internet was still connected,
he must have been located and known about his
situations. So he chose to stay inside the damaged
house with nothing for a while to see if someone would
come. Silence, silence, still silence. With no tools he
could not get any water from the tunnel. He was so
weak. He fell asleep again and resisted to wake up. So
bad dreams came one after the other. He finally found
that sleeping was like choosing to die.

No one came. His robot part began to fall off from his
body. His eyes got no four screens but only one screen
left showing a stock charts with the line climbing or
dipping every second. His fingers were of no battery so both the keyboard one and the pen one
could not move at all. He must have stayed without fuel for three days and that was the limit
when his robot part began to not work well with his bio part. He might get exploded if the sun
would keep being hot like that.

His bio part began to function by itself. He wanted to rub himself to make some sperm. It was
very urgent. His fingers didn’t work. He couldn’t let it cool down itself. He began to cough and
vomit again, which spoiled the fun and his penis looked small and weak like it should be being
in a car chasing.

He found a tap. He opened it and water was running. He then found his clothes were tore and
dirty. Mosquitos and insects were all around. He took off all his clothes and soaked them in a
container with water.

A police stopped by. He asked all the things and found him clean clothes. Then he called Billy’s
landlord who was on a vocation to an island. Free Chilean food cooked by the police’s wife.

Billy Yin was still having the hope he could be repaired. He tried all the stores for the energy he
needed to restart his machine part. He couldn’t breath and the steel, plastic, metal things full
of wires and chips were not nice to carry if they were like bricks. He had passed the three days
limitation of no fuel. His machine part couldn’t be restarted. He phoned Dr Wong from Siemens.
Dr Wong said, think, no panic. If half of you are not functioning, you still have another half. Your
brain is off, you still have a heart. As long as it beats, you could not die. Vampires slept during
day and eat humans during nights. You could be a night comer instead of a day traveler. You
chose yourself again as you had wished to be a robot last time. Pray, hope, wish for it harder and
it will come true.

I want to be an Iron man. Billy Yin said. I don’t want a heart. I want an energy source that would
not die.

No, you can’t. You need a human brain to manage a body like that. Your little miserable life will
end and eternality will come to you. While, not all people could bear the limitations of living in
the dark. Your weakest point will be noon time. You have to sleep with soil in a coffin. Do you
really want to go against the nature again? It is cursed.

What’s the difference? I had always been sleepless and lonely in one morning after another
Oh… when you went back to China you need to ask for night shifts and stick with only night
shifts. You need to kill yourself to announce your physical death and stopped using your ID.
There are professional people hunting vampires, so you can’t be caught. You will be chased till
the end of you day, which would be an endless narrow road. Long life for centuries would be
very lonely. You will like pandas watching humans born and die. We will look like insects and
flies in your eyes.

Give me salty water. Leave me if you can. Radios were playing songs by anonymous singers.
A home high on the mountains…

Billy Yin suddenly noticed that when he woke up in the middle of the dessert, he communicated
with stars which were at times covered by clouds pushed by harsh winds, like a shuttle bus with
light off moving in a midnight airport with orange lights, passing one street lights and another
when it moved on highway between terminals.

Life is short. We kill ourselves in thousands of ways. Watching so many lives passing by in our
life is sometimes like walking through the valley of death, a long narrow path. Only me could
live forever. Billy Yin thought like this when he jumped from the highest tower in Shanghai and
hallucinating that his dead mother was around.

Vampires could jump, run, and fake death. He slept for another few hours in the hospital. Dr
Wong picked him up. From the time he decided to be affected and share blood with a bunch
of AIDS patients, he had months left. Back to China, he bought a life insurance and left a letter
suing his company for inhuman use of employees. He then technically killed himself.

Dr Wong, with a cloth that covered himself fully, burnt Billy Yin in his lab. Siemens destroyed
Billy Yin to hide a failure in its experiment.

### MIDDLE AGE BUSINESSMAN PUT IMPORTED IDOLECENT ON SITE.

He was driving on the highway. There was news saying that Russia was closing pipe line again to Wales.
People owning a car all rushed into local stations to buy fuels. He used to drive in France, where he
worked for American companies and shipped things globally.

He drove a Ford, which was his normal day bike instead of walking. He drove for a living. He drove trunks.
It was like his bike for tour de France. He never slept since his wife died, which means he actually could
work for 24 hours a day if he could maintain the concentration on the wheels and roads.

Miss Lin was a Chinese girl working in a local takeaway. She liked to chat with local guests. She liked to
sleep with them. Old men, young men, couples, she slept with whoever wanted to sleep with her, whoever
who didn’t mind her skin color and appearance. She was wild at heart.

Mr Muffin was on the way to a church service in Ningbo, a city hours from Shanghai by train or by bus.
The clergyman was taking lengthily up there. It was crowded. From the steps of a Sunday service, it was
all the same. The church staff were wearing special made clothes. Mr Muffin took the wrong train. So he
missed the service when he finally arrived at the riverside.

He stopped the car, got into a shop named Gabriel. It was newly furnished. Miss Lin just got out of the
shop with her cheap washing powder back to her boss’s house. She had to sleep with the boss as a second
wife because he took her out of China as a home servant. He always came to Gabriel for Japanese food. He
felt a genital opened to him when she passed him. So he stopped, gave her a look. She was wearing a Zara
trousers which had lost the color a little, a H&M blue shirt with lined patterns very loose, and a bra. She
looked like a virus. Her hair was half white and like a kind of hard brush you used to clean the bathroom.
You could smell the sauces, oil on her. While, her smile was no different with the British. She had a nice
makeup on her eyes. Her lips were like honey dropping and her breast was like two balloons filled with
milk.

This reminded him of his mum who had a big ass and he used to sleep on her thighs. He was kind of sick
these days. He needed mum and mum was not alive any more. Dad used to beat mum when he got really
drunk. Mum always said, men, they had to work to feed us. When he waved his fists to his father, he was
kicked away to the corner.

Mum hooked up with a driver finally and remarried and was gone from his life. He was raised by his
drunk Russian father who slipped on roadside with a bottle of whisky and killed himself. He had a
brother but he could hardly remember him. Maybe he was a gay and was somewhere in Canada’s
forests with another wave of British immigrants.

Mr Muffin was in Ningbo to attend church and find a club called Sanctuary, a place where foreigners
in the city gathered for music and drinks. The Sanctuary was not an open club and didn’t have seats
outside. He found that despite low payment as low as 3000 renminbi per month, foreign teachers were
still willing to work here. To build Tantaras, something in the hell, he had to invite something holy.
While, he found a big whole in this country he had been in for nearly 50 years.

People in Ningbo like a few sculptures in their buildings. He asked to make one of Jesus’s and one of
Mary’s. He got the two and prepared to transport them to the sites far away in central China’s mountain
regions. The sculptures were not that good. They actually looked like anyone on the street. When the
UPS guy asked him what were these as laws said this and that, he answered he was student in art school
and these are his works, After a night’s transportation, they were damaged when arrived. Mr Muffin
ordered two from Italy online. He used UPS again and the shipping guy was the Welsh man.

Welsh man shipped the two sculptures from Italy to Southampton then to Canada then to China. It took
him a month to ensure he slept with them as Mr Muffin requested. Then when he arrived the border
control near Pudong airport, got into another trunk with the goods, he was told he needed a local
driving license. Mr Muffin gave him a fake one.

He could get the Chinese girl’s genitals out of his head. It opened and closed, opened and closed,
sometimes was peeing. They said she was the ugliest flower in Cardiff’s meat market. Videos of her
were online. Miss Lin slept him. She said you have Russian blood, do you? He answered briefly but
proud, yes, my father is Russia. She smiled, I like Russians, they are good looking. He said nothing. She
then said I got a place nearby, could we have some time spent alone in a hotel room, not far, there is a
B&B there you see. She then hesitated that if she should proceed to body contact. FUCK ME. She began
to give him the signal. He solved the problem just in the woods with her. Ten minutes. She said to him
My name is Lin xx, bye, leaving him a takeaway card.

He really was thinking of mum. He felt sick. He needed mother to fall asleep sometimes but after his
wife died in a train crash, he had no one to help him to sleep. He still needed to drive the trunk from
Shanghai’s import harbor to the west most of central China, where trees were green and rocks were
gray. His hair was blondie as if they where white. His Chinese was absolutely none. Mr Muffin was with
him and it took two days. Mr Muffin could hardly speak English. They used gestures to communicate.
After they had put the sculptures of Jesus and Mary up there, local government came. Wars were all
around. Every old province had been a sperate power. Mr Muffin said if you don’t want bigger wars
come, please don’t ask anything. Local government said I know you you are the Dwarf businessman on
TV. Mr Muffin said yes I was on TV. Welsh man was drinking again, with small suchis in his right hand
and a cup of wine on the other. His hair was so shinning that the whole mountain region people said
there was a new gold mine found in the secret project. Local government though it was too shinning,
and they felt uncomfortable to see two suns, so went back to fetch for sun glasses. It was Mr Muffin’s
wrist watch.

Night. Welsh man was completely drunk. The mountain was silent. He slept for the first time after
years. Night sphere. The white Jesus and Mary were in dim light. Stars. Milky way, Mr Muffin was not
sleeping, He had a big hole in the hell to fill in. He paid the Welsh man online. Then he knew that the
foreign man had experienced nightmares recently, unclean things that you can’t rid of in your mind.
He took off the Welsh man’s trousers and pants, put some local herbs on it.

Sunshine and rain. Mr Muffin disappeared into the busy construction site. Welsh man decided to stay
till Mr Muffin finished the project as he thought he had no root in Wales left, and Mr Muffin could be
his companion somehow. Mr Muffin was rich, understanding, and extremely calm. Mr Muffin said he
was too busy to carry a foreign guy around, but the translator translated: Mr Muffin said he liked to suck
your dick.

Over.

### OLD PROFESSOR MET HIS GRANDSON AND FRIENDS.

Bitter melon has two famous versions in movies. One is in Words of gardens when the boy cooked
bitter melon, tomato and noodles. The other one might be quite familiar with Chines audience
when Taiwanese singer and song writer cooked in his first directed movie.

I don’t know how to make cool dishes. While, for vegetables like this, which requires to take the
seeds off with a spoon, I could do pumpkins.

Salted duck egg yolk with pumpkins

Mr Muffin Tin got the Swedish passport years ago. Every popular music was from Sweden. Mr
Muffin Tin was in Air and auto. He liked pop music himself when he was prostituting, he always
turned pop music on while in his daily life, he always sang main stream Chinese songs.

He got along with prostitutes quite well. People with great ability in science always have a big
appetite. People think like this. Rumors spread like this. While for Mr Muffin Tin, he was very
cautious with his private life as during the Cultural Revolution, he could be hardly treated well
as his father was a KMT officer who fled to Taiwan.

He got the job in public restaurants with a very good luck. Or else he could not pass the days of
being angry towards by other people by just staying at home. Then he shut himself in research
and a very careful life as people in academic are easier to be get angry with by other people.

Miss Lin was an IELTS teacher in Beijing. She was not a teacher but an assistant to the examiners.
After five years in the position, she received a call one day which told her that she had been
chosen by Kent University to be a librarian. She was cooking in her kitchen black beans, peppers
and bitter melon to for her high school sister. She had never been abroad. She studied French in
a Beijing school and never though she could talk to a real French in her life.

Five years after the call, she bought a house in Manchester and was a waitress or hostess or
associator in a restaurant in Kent’s countryside.

In the second call of the job interview, the school that they thought she had done a great job for
British Council and they asked how much money she had saved. She answered 50000. They said
that would not be enough. So they offered her a loan and said the job’s pay would be 5000 GBP
per month which could give her a comfortable life and pay back the loan in three months.

Then in the next part, she got all the documents she needed and went on to a five year long
contact with Kent University in Kent, leaving her sister and mother and dad.

Mr Fu was in politics as they said. He arrived in Switzerland safely after a scandal. He got no
money and no friend. He went in to a hostel in Alps. Mr Muffin Tin just had gay sex with a French
man. Mr Muffin Tin had a 50 year old son stuck in China on a big commercial building project.

He felt empowered and excited as a brand new car. He had been afraid all his life. He should not
be afraid any longer. The hotel was just a block away from the hostel. It was Christmas. Mr Fu
was calling everyone he knew in the country to help him. No one would answer him. A Spanish
roommate just from street the night before was to touch him. Mr Fu was shy about this sort of
thing. But he was also curious. So he asked the Spanish for a smoke and a night out together in
a club where he got his hands all on the Spanish. Then on the second day, they rented a house
and split the bills.

The French man was naked on the sofa. Mr Muffin Tin got out to buy some milk before local
supermarket was closed. He would be an invited lecture in Kent University in spring. So he
decided to learn French well with this French boy who was 19 years old till Spring comes. He
would carry him around Switzerland where he had been to several times. He would mate him
when he was willing or not. He picked the man from Paris’’s street and could actually treat him
as a slave, but he had other intentions.

Hopefully in Spring the young French would have been pregnant and bring the young kids by
himself.

For Mr Fu, he was quite flexible with these things. He didn’t feel it disgusting and unacceptable. Quoting
James Bond, “how do you know I have never tried gay’?”’ You know, in China, men are divided into big men
and small men. Small men are servants and big men are public servants. Small men should do everything
to please big men and sucking dicks is one of the services. Mr Fu had travelled all around the world and
was not a conservative person.

When Mr Muffin was young and working in a Shanghai factory. He came back home once a week to cook
for Mr Muffin Tin. He always cooked bitter melon and tomato noodles for his father if his mother was out
to paly majiang. He knew his father had lots of bitterness that could not be expressed. And though his
father cooked everyday for his mother, Mr Muffin could feel that there was a tension that could not be
explained clearly in his parent’s marriage. So though he managed to get the vegetable, red and green sauce
to each piece of noodle, he still got not clue of what the big thing was there in his parent’s relationship. It
was until when his father sent him a photo of himself in a gay wedding with a Taiwanese old man that Mr
Muffin got shocked and explained.

And may his father live long and happy after in Kent. Miss Lin quitted after a week in the job. She felt it
boring and British were very rude to her. She suddenly could not pay the rent and the loan. Then after five
years in restaurants, she could tell Chinese students now still her customers that teaching English is not
a way to survive.

Even when she was living with a cat and his first-floor roommate who was a doctor moved away suddenly
just because a Chinese moved in, she didn’t tell herself it is the end. She knew it was the beginning of
another period of life and it had been magical. She got English breakfast with 2 pounds instead of a 30 RMB
Chinese or American style breakfast she could never afford. She could go to cinemas often with English
subtitles. She dated a French waiter who just turned 20 and lived with a 73 year old Chinese teacher.

Life is so good. When Mr Muffin Tin was sick on bed himself, his grandson with his girlfriend, with a local
Chinese businessman Mr Fu whose new restaurant was newly bankrupt and closed, came together to see
him. They talked lengthily before Mr Muffin Tin fell asleep in afternoon sunshine and smell of roses.
Mr Muffin said though he was an expert in planes and cars, he never felt relaxed. He was drugged down by
lots of money related things. Though, he never made himself drunk just because it could be unbearable.

### 15 Young Chinese financier made a copy of himself.

Night person, hate daylight, he is kind of out space person. In the future, the sun is dead. Earth has been polluted. Only moon light and stars. Nothing is growing.

Looking for friends. 1. Talk. 2. Share rents. 3. Sick, drunk, in trouble, in grief… 4. Do sports. 5. Debts of 30000rmb and it mountains itself

Things happened in the past has been dusts… They will never exist again. Regretting is like living in sorrows and memories. It is a good way to let your competitors stop.
Billy Yin is a night person. He hates daylight. He is kind of out space person. In the future, the sun is dead. Earth has been polluted. Only moon light and stars. Nothing is growing.

Billy Yin took a lunchbox to work. He got up early. It was still dark. His dad just called him to go back home to sell toilet. He could imagine that he sent name card to his friends: Billy Yin, sell manager in shower, toilet and basin solutions.

Years after his struggle in Shanghai, he thought that his dad was right: a private toilet is everything to pass the cold winter in the city with no heating. He took two chicken filets from the old fashioned fridge, cut them into some chunks, quickly stir fried the Sichuan spicy chicken, put them into his lunchbox, hurried out with toothpaste still on his mouth. Billy Yin lived in Pudong, he had to be quick to catch the sunrise and first bus and then subway.

His sister was on the morning bus’s small annoying screen. Sometimes he could see her reporting in a hurricane affected Pacific country. While her face was pushed by the wind, and sometimes hit by burgers: cheese, beef, tomato, bread, yes, hit, Billy Yin was nicely enjoying the joy of garlic from baozi in the morning bus. Bloody hell. He said. Could you stop eating spring onion, garlic and pork… His sister had a style of dressing: more and more like the BBC reporters: big piece of clothes cut in shapes and neatly seamed. Billy Yin was wearing suits: he had to, he got clients to meet.

The bus began to stop and stop in jams. Once his sister said directing movies could have some privileges as every hit movie could let stupid assholes think years after years. Billy Yin didn’t watch movies. He was a theater goer. In movies actors sometimes did art, but in theaters actors are really making art. Thinking like that, he hit a button in his half robot body, time stopped. He wanted to fuck a girl with a flower like dress opened to him. It was morning, he somehow felt great need to fuck someone. He opened her dress, put his hand into her pant. He then finished his intend, left some liquid and seeds into another body.

He fastened his belt, got back to where he was standing. He clicked the button again. The farmers from all other parts of China presumed to ask the Shanghainese in Shanghainese: what’s the next station? Then Billy Yin got off the bus, flushed himself into a carriage, stuck himself with his phone for another 15 minutes, then he found he left the lunchbox somewhere near the seat of the girl he had fucked.

He remembered that her breasts were full and the nipples were not soft. She was on when the time stopped. The girl had the need to be fucked. Half robot Billy Yin could see through that. The girl’s licks were not sweet and her teeth were not white. Though small and thin, she was not the perfect egg for the seeds.

A man needs to be settled into a woman’s body. It’s like the fucking building where Billy Yin was working in. Officialism, white shirt, finance, money, investment, business, consultancy, funds, suits, mugs, papers… fake or real businesses filled the city. While, not all of them could afford a nice office building. Some were in stock market, some were not in stock market, and Shanghai Security Newspaper was absolutely something Billy Yin used to sit on on dirty public seats. Billy Yin was working for a real financial company. The building was horribly unnoticed with no FamlilyMart around. It was a branch of British Business Review, whose building was also sitting in a corner of unnoticed London.

While, after ten minutes in work, just waiting for Bloomberg Terminal opened, a notification disturbed the genius Billy Yin. His seeds got into the egg and another copy of the machine was planted into another human flesh. Billy Yin didn’t have a private toilet in his rented countryside house. He peed into the bottles from the drinks. He had no kettle. He had no tea sets. It was rainy and planes were passing by. A kind of sadness and lonely came and came again together with the cold autumn chill. He was not alone now. He had a copy.

Cottons, vegs were planted near Shanghai. The girl got fucked felt hungry, ate the packed lunch she found on her right hand. Her blood became green. Her red meat exploded after the fast growing process of forming the machine organs. Half digested Sichuan chicken breast with rice were found by the police later.

The sun had died. Dark clouds with heavy polluted mist covered the whole region. Though Shanghai was said to be the last port of light, it had fallen into the enemies’ control. Billy Yin’s company sighed a contract with the space ship institute. He had to prepared for a three months working in the dessert.

The host of the news channel had a live broadcast and a big coverage on the triton exploration project. The host was naked, because the studio was too hot. He sat there, with a touch screen on the glass table in front of him and a box of three flavor ice cream with a plastic spoon. His watch was shinning, a piece of jewel was also shinning. People could afford air conditioner no longer if it cooled down by one degree, the outside’s temperature could be higher by two degree: no one wanted to put an ice box into a heated wok. The host was under a huge pressure as he was from another region, couldn’t pronounce the Shanghainese well. So when the camera switched to other videos and audios, he quickly asked his assistant about the right pronunciation. He didn’t wear any because the region was poor and no sponsor want to provide the clothes. His skin had been newly changed which also needs air and light. Everyone understand it: it is ok to be naked for any reason. Miles away, Billy Yin’s sister poped up into the camera frame. She was in a space suit. She looked not being able to control the gravity. When she wanted to walk, she was jumping. Oh, what a wonderful place for flying and sword fighting. She put a flag of China onto Triton’s land, but she was not the first one there, astronaut had been there long time before a journalist could travel there.

Later when she became Swedish officially and the mysterious death of his brother happened, she finally stopped draining resources from the mother Neptune. Her long lemon yellow hair was yielding in the moon’s air. The host said one line which make all the audience laugh: Oh, please tell me you would like to have a nice drink, hot bath and stop using public money for expensive travelling for a second.

That made Billy Yin laugh too. He owned no toilet of his own. He had to rest for an hour before cooking his dinner. Working on the space project could be better, at least it was state money and no crowded bus, no unrelated people, no fuck on a bus, no playing phone on subway: absolutely heaven’s job. Having made his last phone call which he deliberately prolonged, other colleagues had left. He called the girl he had fucked in the morning.

Sorry, I left my lunchbox near you seat on the bus this morning. Could you kindly to give it back to me?

Oh, who’s this? I did, ate the rice and chicken from an anonymous lunchbox. I threw it.

Shit, oh I mean thank god, are they tasty? I have to buy the Family Mart sushi today.

Then the girl exploded after screaming.

Good evening, my copy.

### Middle age businessman was a pervert.

“duty first”. Mr Muffin is a “just” person. He is so morally right. When seasons change, he notices the sun is leaving the north. Though cold weather is good for health, a tiredness person like him would like to go to the Tibet to enjoy more sunshine. After meeting and mating the Welsh man, he has a strange smell of black feather, a smell of death. His flesh disappears during nights and regain its shape during the day. Being in a relationship is brutal, esp. for men with a fortune. He begins, restarts his habit of sleeping with strangers for body pleasure. Can’t resist it. Can’t ignore it. -Interview with Luke Evans.

Man fucks man, this man is conquered. Man fucks woman, this woman is conquered. These is no woman alone that could survive. Men are born bigger and stronger. Women are born smaller and therefore in need for protection.
When Mr muffin was rich, he lived in hotels like a joke, and threw money like shit into the deep hole.
Men kill men and get their women…it’s normal.

adWhen Mr Muffin knew that he could not die, he wanted to live, come back to life. Life needs water and sunshine. A dried flower could open again in hot water, and, if there are enough sunshine, it grows quickly. He struggled to find the ingredients, conditions to come back to life, but that was hard, he took years to find the right kind of pineapple. Then he gave up, knowing that it is a one way ticket only through the life and death door. He had something unfinished, so he could not two feet in death to another world to meet his long lost lover.

He had to finish the things, so he could die in peace and disappear. There was no home, just the end. His options were pageup and pagedown the hundreds of long years of living as a shadow. He had been an excellent cook, as he knew the things growing on earth quiet well, and had seen many of them becoming protected animals. He was also an excellent builder. Men verse nature, he had seen so much, and had learned so much. With the devil’s strength, he could force rocks and woods and cut them, freeze them, heat them to form anything he wanted. He knew well about how gravity works and how things get along with each other. He could summon storms and mist.

He was the kind of “duty first” guy. Once programmed with missions, though the owner had died, the robot would still continue working on the missions. As a businessman from cloth to construction materials, he was not a money oriented person. He immigrated to Ireland in 1997, and had worked in software companies for years. He held a jewel design master degree so due to his natural interest, he needed gold, silver and other metals to put diamonds in. He found China had made itself the largest exporter of gold. He would like to get a deal with the gold mines to maintain a cheaper supply of gold. The only thing he was expected to exchange for the deal was a praise, like the one a teacher gives to a small child.

Mr Muffin secretly hid his immigration from his dad who was Swedish. His dad was very well educated and had always been in academic. His dad described research like fishing in the pacific. If the fisherman wanted tuna cans to export to China, they had to face the waves and sharks. Mr Muffin thought his dad was good looking with beard all over and captain like. The navigator, his father held the wheel in the sea of waves. Layers of dark clouds covered the blue sky and sharks were all around. They had to kill one shark to pay for an IMac, or they needed to catch lots of other fishes. The boat had been turned upside down. Mr Muffin and other strongmen managed to turn the boat back. Then they were took by a helicopter to a larger steel ship, where they caught a shark successfully, that was the only warmth and light they get in the cold Pacific: efforts got paid. Back to the fish market, the old Muffin Tin was relaxed and happy.

Mr Muffin Tin’s long lost lover was photographed naked with detailed private place exposed by a Welsh photographer. The girl was raped and murdered. It was snowing. The murderers were cornered by him on a beach. Foams, waves seagulls. They fought. Then during the ages of getting old, the lonely man kept sculpting the young lady, which made his wife very angry. They were married and he promised to build a governor’s mission, park, big house with lots of rooms, and for her. While, what he got was another woman.

The Welsh man with Mr Muffin didn’t know that this lovely short Chinese middle aged, was not only a dick sucker, a sodomy lover, but a blood drinker. During their gay sex in thousands of ways, legal or illegal, group or not you could imagine, Mr Muffin had been capable to avoid any sex transmitted disease which, even for the British with free medical care is a hard job. Literally, losing a hand or a half a head, they would grow out again for Mr Muffin. His only problem was the sunlight. He knew the weather very well and felt it proper to follow the sun to Tibet during winters, his responsibility of protecting the good, the harmony, sometimes led him to get burnt. As a lawyer, you could not get burnt. He ate human food, shit, and kept a large supply of wine with O, B, A, AB, goat, lion…labeled.

Mr Muffin knew he was only a shadow. Long time ago, he was a king with his servants and armies. He had been a cunning communicator. He once was a journalist, spreading fake news, lots of his news were exaggerated and false. He then became a consultant for politicians. He trusted no one. He did lots of research.

Looking at the reflection of the sky in a pond where golden and red fishes were kept, he remembered all the people died in politics. He liked the Himalayas where one continent hit another. It’s green. Waterfalls. A feast of plants he liked. He knew the harshness of the nature itself and the wrath of god. The earth was young, then prehistory activity of humans, then the classic time of his. He stood on the side of humans. He knew humans love nature as long as they are in an all glass ball: not getting wet, not getting harmed. He also felt he is not one of them.

Life forms on the earth are one way only. Lots of people come and go in Mr Muffin’s long life.

### Old professor told about his war experience.

HONG KONG (Google)
Monica Lin was studying French. After years of teaching in China, she got a job in Canada and met the first French. Shen then opened a restaurant in Vancouver. 
Her young husband, 21, has been a head in McDonald’s in Spain, gay though. Professor Muffin Tin, 74, is an airplane expert. He helped the young man with a degree in engineering.

HONG KONG (Google) Monica was studying in French. After years of teaching in China, she got a job in Canada and met the first French. She then opened a restaurant in Vancouver.

Her young husband has been a head in a McDonald’s, gay though. Professor Muffin Tin is an airplane expert. He helped the young man with a degree in engineering.

Covel Greenwood was based on my previous landlord in Fuzhou in Fujian province in China. He fell for his second son, Dawei, who has the most beautiful face the dad has ever met. Does he want to sleep with his second son? He always doubted. He designed a way for him as a combination of a baker and fisherman. He wanted his second son tender hearted, sweet and of lots of courage. On the contrary, the boy turned out to be too plain with no gift. While the first son was making a good life with his tongue, the second could hardly finish any adventures. He has to stay at hometown where wages are lower.

After years of separation, he finally arranged a meeting with the boy, a subway engineer in Shanghai. It was after midnight. In a VIP area, two young sleepy boys were serving the food. Mr Dawei was pretty old then. He didn’t wash his hand, bought a swiss roll and instant noodle. He was working on a new branch of subway in the netting process of Shanghai. Mr Covel was on his way to Russia and the other four countries in north Europe. He was in transit with a 72 hour pass visa. His son was still catching him. Mr Dawei looked like a deer in the night’s perfect light. His skin was white. His face was clearly created and positioned with thin a thin brush. He took the cake out of the package. He didn’t mind that the dustbin’s lid was dirty. He opened it then threw the package. Mr Covel wanted to hold his son’s hands. He knew that he must have suffered a lot. He could imagine that working on a subway’s construction, his son sometimes didn’t shave, with a bar of smoke on his hand, under a tight schedule, looked terrible. Mr Dawei was sleepless during nights. He didn’t order anything special for his meeting with his dad. He didn’t treat him as his dad. It was his normal every night meal. His smell of body, his shyness during teenager years, his well grown breasts, his easiness, had become framed pictures which Mr Covel finally got lost in the sea of people.

Professor Muffin Tin watched his wife’s corpse being burnt with the rest of his railway neighbors in the McDonald’s. He then remembered that during all these years of being abroad, he had never bought a Gucci scarf for his wife. He then went to a Gucci shop, asking for a silk scarf under 10000 renminbi. The patterns were flowers and birds. They are one piece of drawing and didn’t repeat. He then boarded a plane with the scarf for his dead wife. It was cold on the plane. He wrapped himself in the scarf like a wallpaper. My wife is a pig, a hog, a swine. Yes, she was the most disgusting creature. Every day the former chef went to shopping, he stared at the pork, asking for lamb. Pigs eat their own shits. He and his wife slept in separated rooms. When they had sex, he punished her to make her cry. The day he wanted finally to kill his wife, he did some research on how to kill a pig. Bloody hell, he stared at the smelly, laughing, shouting, nightmare like people shopping, quarrelling, bargaining in the grocery area; and suddenly a very fat girl under ten just ate a very thin middle age struggling man.

The battle of Westfall happened when Professor Muffin Tin was very young. The then cornbelt of China was the old royal lands. The place was not very successfully looked after and threats turned the once rich farm land into an environmentally fragile place. After the Taiping occupation of eastern Jiangsu, old Shanghai was swelled with refugees. Foreign banks and companies got into China during 1912 to 1935, when the country was trying to build itself. Professor Muffin Tin was following the government’s post to protect northeast China.

It was a bloody battle. Godsent. Godsent. They could find spring onion, ginger root, garlic and red chilies. Ginger roots were not peeled and had been washed. Garlics were pink and white. Potatoes, mangos, fish, chickens, sesame, vinegar, soybeans were also growing. They wanted to make it slow so people would have time to think if they were being followed. There was little possibility of a win, like a girl who loves football and has devoted herself into the sport but with little possibility to get funded and win a medal. His skin was white, then turned black after a summer. He absolutely loved the country. Waves after waves of enemies were pouring in. He was swift, wearing a pair of light, knee height leather shoes. He was underage for a war like that. He used fire well. He was good at traps. He took an afternoon’s time, none stop, waiting for the enemies to be poisoned. He added things little by little. He killed 40 per night. Blood was everywhere so they had to clean it every hour.

892bca48684509.589ea077855b8There was a plane coming to pick people to leave. Professor Muffin Tin never think of leaving. Once captured, it could be slavery. After the war, Paris was spared physical destruction, while Shanghai was in Diminish, professor Muffin Tin had to go to China Town to cook. He went to Sichuan and cooked a very good Sichuan spicy chicken. I have always thought that myself has been the drought boy waiting for a fire ring, while, I am not. I was born as a monster and would be a monster to seduce and kill for a living. I grab the unfortunate boys into the bottom of the pond for some changes to have food. Once noticed that I am the bread scrub, I made myself into a meatball and when I was juicy in others’ month, I was crying. Time, time, catch every deadline but can’t avoid a careless slip. The clock in my hand dropped onto the ground, like a 5D Mark 3 dropped onto a concrete ground, into pieces. The liquid of time is gone. Mark is always absent on a voyage. Monica is like deaf in the French restaurant. Kill everyone in your way, then you could see the bloody way out. There is no fire ring. It’s your own bare hand with a knife robbing everyone.

Mr Muffin was so mean that he didn’t want to share anything with anyone. He just wished that his forever glass car would run forever, no matter how the earth and humans change. He behaved like a man driving a car with the windows shut. Even when he could actually see that he had hit a man, he pretended that he was hearing and feeling nothing and there was nothing under the car. He just ran away.

He was half dead. Living men are like a plus. Dead men are like a minus. He was zero. Autumn leaves began to fall. Rain one after another. Boys wore shirts outside their t shirts. He lived in the Himalayas’ most luxury building’s highest floor. His only friend was living in another hotel 200 meters away. His building was four seasons estate’ product. He just landed his paper box onto the roof. His only friend was an actor, living in the five floor hotel’s 5th floor. His friend looked at Mr Muffin’s paper box in the cloud with the shinning logo of the estate company in early morning. His friend was not lucky. He was poor. So he wrote a letter to Mr Muffin, a house owner. Mr Muffin didn’t reply. It was eight years after they graduated from a wizard school. Mr Muffin had years and years of fortune. His friend looked at another not so fancy a department between the two buildings, thinking that it was not right to stare at the shinning things in the city center.

After twenty years, his friend became a successful actor. He moved out of the Himalaya’s where there was no electricity, no water and no gas. He did remember sometimes there was no paper box on that highest building. He thought it was the clouds. He now lived no longer in crowded, 3*5 no window, noisy hotel rooms. He lived in private land with a singer house in Beijing. No one could disturb him. He had been in roles in many films. Mr Muffin somehow became a poor guy. He sold the paper box, had to do hard shipping jobs for a living. He contacted his only friend he had lost in the sea of people. The actor said, you were cheating me twenty years ago. You didn’t have the house in the most luxury building. They told me the highest floors were always only affordable for foreigners.

They knew each other. They were the only two of the kind that could not die. Mr Muffin had a team of five and he had to record what was happening on this planet. He switched from the mountains to the sea after three episodes. There was still only a 0.5*3 meters window in his box where he kept his coffin, soil, plants, clothes, films and bath. When he chose shield on, the box would be invisible and free from any harms, like a gay in closet.

Mr Muffin was a king. Not like Professor Muffin Tin who had limited time left and had been slow needing young lovers to take him to parties, Mr Muffin did not like the noisy night clubs in Bristol. He had several properties in the England. He was excellent in cooking, excellent in building. He was a master and could master anything men had invented in the war with nature. When he talked with men, he must have had an intention: blood, or money.

Flying in times is like a shadow into anyone’s life. Today he is a normal guy on a bus, tomorrow he must be witnessing volcanos and waves. Eight years, Billy Yin had earned 400000. His only friend killed himself many times while wondering in the woods of mushrooms that could not be eaten, hungry in the dark, wet, narrow forest of art which a poor country could not afford. Mr Muffin was cunning. He knew that art needs money. He did trading rather than art. Once, he was in his car, noticing the actor, his only friend in the world, was walking on the walkway, with breakfast of a bun and soybean milk, hurried into a theater for small roles. It was raining, raindrops were on his window. His friend just disappeared into the dreaming world. He understood fully why his friend was suffering. Eight years ago, his friend chose to do art and art needs money. Then his friend only dreamed to be rich but never had a well paid job. Mr Muffin thought like this while his plane landed in Ireland. Same kind of rain and plants, but full of seagulls and sausages.

He just couldn’t open his car to tell his only friend that being immortal is a curse and in order to live against life and death, one had to be real. One had to know how much a nail cut is and how much a cabbage is. Cooking itself defined civilization. When his friend ate in cheap restaurants and stalls, poor guys around were like worms and snakes feeding themselves. When later he tried cooking, he didn’t feel that he was a monster with no intelligence. While when he was lost in stories, costumes and scenes, he could even not read the instruction before using his phone.

Mr Muffin had a doctor, his father who was an environment expert. Mr Muffin had a designer who was a specialist in weapons and tools. Mr Muffin also had an engineer who made robots and dolls: humans are Mr Muffin’s pets and research objects. When humans wanted to study from birds to make planes, they were actually like the birds: they had to move their wings very quickly to fly over the mountains with the flocks; they look funny and not smart. Mr Muffin knew that humans could understand and learn from the past and could measure. He controlled them to collect information.

A deer, humans is only a deer in Mr Muffin’s planet earth. His actor friend once was in Mr Muffin’s business. He was given a job. But when movies were on, he was told to chase his dreams on a phone screen or translated cinemas. Then he couldn’t get up at six in the morning to catch the morning bus and he thought it was not his right job. Mr Muffin just wished his best friend best luck in this old world where there is no light but only sandstorm.

He sipped tea and it was raining or heatwaves outside the paper box. He could see that through the long narrow window. His friend finally got famous and rich as an actor. His best friend’s rehearsal room was just under his paper box. It took time. If we don’t want to compromise on the look and the quality of the life we build for ourselves, we have to wait. Even these guys who could not die need to wait.

### s

Monica Lin, who has a whole English world of her own, was sexy, beautiful. The French young boy, could never bear seeing people starving, was happy with a free internet. When Monica Lin was in Spain for her Spanish course, the young boy was a teacher in a museum for children group visits. Monica Lin knew that she might disappear as a tiny particle of sugar into hot water in the new world. She took one thing from China: a chef certificate. Professor Muffin Tin had taught students for a long time as his career. The old man was a crazy fan of a Taiwanese band. Monica Lin finally had an office job. The young boy had an engineer degree. A cake, card, flower shop was opened.

The eldest daughter of the newspaper editor was working as the father’s assistant. The restaurateur was strong and fit. He is rich like Carrefour’s boss. When people are poor, they must keep themselves happy, or they could do nothing with a bad mode. The restaurateur became poor in a night’s time, as poor as the French boy who was picked up by Professor Muffin Tin from Paris’ street. He had enemies in politics. In the country he came from, there was no free internet.

The eldest daughter of the editor one day lost her golden ball into a well. She asked a frog to pick it up for her in exchange to kiss the frog. The restaurateur had nothing under his name and ugly indeed. All he could manage to get is to play with rich people’s kids to keep an income. Monica Lin took away fried noodles from the Chinese buffet on the other side of the bank. Then hung up the phone call from Mr frog. She was from to school in Canada and had worked for top companies. She could teach doctor students. The old king was a great fan of the famous restaurateur who was once rich and now poor. He wanted her daughter to have an interview, and take photos of the frog for the supplement. He forced his daughter to keep the promise as the frog had found the golden ball.

The eldest daughter refused the proposal from the restaurateur. The restaurateur said, I am a sailor, I fight with the sea and weather to get my money and fame. I won’t be around all the time. I promise you that every time I hear your call from wherever on this planet, I would be present with the speed of light. The daughter said, you are not good enough for me. You can’t even speak French. Kill yourself. Then she threw the frog onto the wall. Small business owners in the country where the cursed prince was from were heavily taxed that year. Nothing from cakes to flowers to cards were profiting. They threw the government down that night.

Mr King got his interview and news. The daughter found herself mean. She was presented a heart of gold. Never judge a man by his possession.

Chinese food means a lot. Rainy, sell myself in the age women were not independent and travel was difficult. Study English, end up in receptionist. Wait for an old man’s help. There is nothing in this world that money could not buy, not to say a citizenship.

Marrying to a foreign person is like “voyaging the pacific alone” and, to say goodbye to childhood. It often ends up in disaster in reality. When the old man is dead, the only warmth is from a fucking husband. Oh, fuck oneself.

Mooncake festival was coming. It was raining and there was no moon. Monica Lin had been sick for a long time. She asked the servant to open the window for her. She had a feeling that she could not live till the end of the year. The French boy was still in university for the degree. Study was hard. He was full time study. His financial status was like a paper made umbrella caught in heavy wind and rain. He could not afford to pay before eating a bowl of rice. He took shelter in small temples and helped by his teachers. He always said: oh, good sister Monica, you are the goddess. Monica Lin died. She asked the servant to put her carefully framed self portrait near the rock in her garden. The family moved, left the garden. When the French boy visited the garden, he found the painting. The dead Monica had a reunion with the French boy in capital city. They rented a house. The boy became rich and powerful of high social rank en la fin. The illustrations of this story were painted by French brand pencils and water color, made in Kunshan, a small city on the skirt of Shanghai.

### 17 MR MUFFIN SHOT VIDEOS IN POTAGONIA FOR BILLY YIN. – INTERVIEW WITH HUGH, MICHAEL AND JAMES

Mr Muffin was driving a Ford. He heard that people were calling John the baptizer the angle for the hungry and poor, then he heard that people were calling him the lord for the sick. In his mind, from his classic time, he had betrayed too many people. He could hear them cursing him.

Winds, pine trees, he could hear them in his four season hotel’s highest floor bedroom. He didn’t like sunlight at all. Wherever he went, he brought a cloud of mist with him. People say he is dark, truly because there had been too much darkness in his memory.

Mr Muffin was born and raised in great Turkey land, where the sea and mountains are both not far. So when people want protection, they hide in father mountain. When they want to risk there life for flowers of the sea on the seabed, they dance with sharks and dive into the water that covers 71% of the earth: they go back to mum’s body.

He remembered that the first car was invented by Mr Ford and the first lamp was invented by Mr Edison. He could not drive as he was too used to horse carriages. He could command horses. He could not control machines. So, he gave up and hired drivers since he bought the first car. Mr Muffin was in a fraudulent community of Christians. He wanted to eat human, esp the strong and well muscled. He could not do that by himself. There were thousands of unarmed low price workers as refugees in lots of countries who are lonely, discriminated. They went to the community of Christians every Sunday to sing their little hope and their little gods. After that, men felt purified like Céstbon water and that’s the time they appeared most lovely and naïve and unarmed. They cooked the human in McDonald’s. Sometimes cooked with baby potatoes, baby chickens and lamb.

Mr Muffin just want the Welshman’s body. He only wanted him. In the past, he used to wake up on different beds with strangers or not whom he had had communicated fleshly. He ran a full body health check of the human he had sexual intercourse with. He sucked dicks of taxi drivers right in the cars. He slept with athletes and sport school male students. He even had sex with them in public toilets which are filthy, unresisted unhealthy and smelly, therefore unique and unforgettable. They liked him as he appeared to be foreign, pale, old and rich.

When spiders spin the cross on his wall upside down, he stopped sleeping with unrelated people and making connections physically. He was the old time good and faithful Christian. He hated gays. He stopped for years until the Welsh driver came into his life. Mr Muffin was from a well educated family. He was short, like to eat in Kungfu steamed food. He was lovely.

Being both gifted and cursed, he didn’t miss a second of bodily pleasure, never give up to volatilities and stupid governments, but, mais, he obeyed the rules of nature. He obeyed all the rules. He was a wizard traversing the tranquil crowds to fight ghosts that hurt humans. He was so strong and powerful that he must protect the human world from harms. He had an army of snakes, spiders, mice, wolves, man made humans.

While, at this moment, Mr Muffin was in the school, with a group of gay priests, thinking of the Welsh driver’s soft body all the time. Study was hard. Professor Muffin Tin was teaching in Kent and dating the French man. Mr Muffin was in debts from his last failed project of an underground city. Billy Yin was kind of enjoying failed projects in cities: it reminded him that he was living in the future. He saw the communist’s annual meeting room was in abundance in east Europe and he felt a sense of faded glory in the empty buildings once filled with smiling consumers and shops. As a spaceship falling from the sky and ran out of fuel forever, it reminded him of one thing lord Voldemort had said: only love lives forever.

Billy Yin was recently working in a space tourism site as a tech support assistant. Nothing was growing and they only had instant noodles, frozen food, packed reheated plane food, and bottled waters. He felt more tears in the waterless and soundless moon like dessert. His eyes damp itself. Sadness. He felt that most life forms came to the end.

He fell and had been sent to military hospitals. He thought about Tibet. Though he had been born as a Canadian, he had never experienced high altitudes, sunshine and timeless way of living. Tibet was not very far. If by car, he could arrive at Lesha in two days’ drive. He hadn’t had a car. His dad was a steady income government officer regulating local food safety. He never wanted a car as he had been in Shanghai relying on public transport for so long.

The team manager was an interesting 40 year old senior. He thought that Billy Yin had been so sick after his visit to South Africa and Chile. He noticed that. So when Billy Yin had both time and free medical care, he took him out by a Jeep, showed him the points of owing a car and a camera. I want to fly so I bought a car. He told Billy Yin. When Billy Yin joined the company he was thinking of buying a Ford. Now he rented a car anywhere he went by Henz.
Billy Yin was a lab test result and beta of Siemens and Chinese army’s special joint national security level project, he woke up in an all clean, cold and white lab with no sunlight. He could remember nothing. Until one day he found that he was not a creation of the nature. He thanked god deeply in his heart, if he still had one, that his mother gave birth to him.

Mother earth, though some human tried to be the mom. Billy Yin was so sick that he had been relying on breathing machine. His heart failed. The Chinese doctors couldn’t stop his internal bleeding in his stomach. He had blue blood, which he joked with his sister was because of drinking Pepsi too much. He would like to see birds, wild animals and all the other creatures. It made him feel the good of being alive.

He had no hope. He knew that he could never afford a private toilet in any part of the world. He always stayed in motels for business travelling. He got his small corner in Shanghai but he knew that big money won’t came to his riverside as there is no trading ships stopping in a place with no harbor. He paid his rents every first day of the month, and ate crisps of Layers and a box of apples his classmate sent to him from her lab. For one whole month, his machine part functioned badly. He could not eat anything.

He had no hope. Her sister was lying and lying on TV for the incompetence of local industries. His sister, logically in his brain. His sister, so why do I have no memory of my childhood wit such a female? His sister once said, men here are stupid and deaf, I have to cover for them like a hen for its baby chickens. After her marriage with the Swedish white man, Billy Yin understood perfectly some people don’t do as what they say.

Mr Muffin was invited by the military to treat Billy Yin who kept a high fever and flakey skin. His joints were all bruised, swelled with internal bleeding. His eyes were red. Mr Muffin was one of the secret doctors in several countries’ military, specializing in strange diseases and aliens. He had adopted by Ireland for 20 years and he had been a very double agent.

He sucked all of Billy Yin’s blood every night so every morning Billy Yin’s machine part had to run by itself rather that exploiting Billy Yin’s flesh. But only for a while, the doctor had to give the blood back. He remembered that it was not the first human who had been turned into a robot.

Mr Muffin took Billy Yin into his paper box. They landed in Chile where Billy Yin had been damaged. Billy Yin had not recovered. He found Mr Muffin good looking, charming and tender.
