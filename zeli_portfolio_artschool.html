I captured river in early spring, flowers, snow and Buddhist temples. Then from April to June I worked as an apprentice chef in Zhejiang province. I also shoot some videos about the locals. In July I finally got back to my computer and the whole video was assembled and edited in Beijing with a narrative written and read by myself. <p>

        Title: The wild<p>
        Material: Chinese ink on paper<p>
        Size: maybe broadsheet newspaper size<p>
        I posted the photos of it onto Behance. The page (actually two pages put together) here is a part of a 4-page cartoon. The original file is lost. You could head to my Behance for the whole story.<p>
        Description: In 2016 I somehow read a piece of news about a university student who killed his mother in Fuzhou, Fujian province. I did some research and drew a picture as a fake ad for a famous brand. I bought a bottle of ink and found it very useful to make black and white drawings. I was in Fujian from April that year. I rented from July 1st 2016 till April 1st 2017 in Fuzhou. A friend of mine from school helped to pay my rent and living expenses for nearly a whole year. I wrote a script and translated it into this 4-page, interesting cartoon. The story might not make sense. It might be inspired by the three Tin Tin cartoons, Tibet, Blue Lotus and Exploring the moon, which I purchased in the UK. In 2016 I began to put two companies’ brands a lot in my drawings. <p>

        Title: le mond<p>
        Material: digital<p>
        Size: unknown<p>
        I posted it onto my Wechat moments. The original file is lost.<p>
        Description: It is the drawings I mentioned in the description of last image. The little girl with a bottle was a hotel guest with wet hair I met in elevator. The whole idea looks horrible from today if you look carefully at what is in this picture. The idea of comparing a famous drink with blood on women’s underwear. It was drawn on a phone app. There was a fancier version of this picture, more complicated, which might take a whole month to be made. <p>
