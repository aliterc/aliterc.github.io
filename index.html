<p>Ze Li</p>
<p>I am a senior media company manager working for Wong Yong and Zhu Chen magazine. After graduated from Cardiff University with a failed dissertation talking about frauds endlessly, lacking journalistic skills, I got an offer from Vancouver Film School for film production. I read The Guardian film reviews. I have applied for NYU Tisch school twice. I don't read entertainment news. I know a little about lightning and sculpting. Dr Richard Clayton from Cambridge Univeristy once gave me an interview. I had shortly stayed in print shops and then wanted to make my own weekly online channel. After that, I shot photos and shared them online with a moving workstation. I found that I hardly know any Americans though film making really needs Americans.</p>

#8-18-2018-BUSINESS- VW's CEO was told about emissions software months before scandal: Der Spiegel</p>
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) Chief Executive Herbert Diess was told about the existence of cheating software in cars two months before regulators blew the whistle on a multi-billion <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/exhaust_1">exhaust</a> emissions scandal, German magazine Der Spiegel said.</p>
Der Spiegel’s story, based on recently unsealed documents from the Braunschweig prosecutor’s office, raises questions about whether VW informed investors <u>in a <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/timely?q=timely">timely</a> manner</u> about the scope of a scandal which it said has cost it more than $27 billion in penalties and fines.</p>
<p><strong>VW's CEO was told about emissions software months before scandal: Der Spiegel</strong></p>
<p>FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) Chief Executive Herbert Diess was told about the existence of cheating software in cars two months before regulators blew the whistle on a multi-billion exhaust emissions scandal, German magazine Der Spiegel said.</p>
<p>Der Spiegel’s story, based on recently unsealed documents from the Braunschweig prosecutor’s office, raises questions about whether VW informed investors in a timely manner about the scope of a scandal which it said has cost it more than $27 billion in penalties and fines.</p>
<p>The Braunschweig prosecutor’s office was not reachable for comment on Saturday.</p>
<p>Volkswagen’s senior management, which has denied wrongdoing, is being investigated by prosecutors in Braunschweig, near where Volkswagen is headquartered, to see whether the company violated disclosure rules.</p>
<p>U.S. regulators exposed VW’s cheating on Sept. 18, 2015.</p>
<p>Responding to the magazine report, the carmaker <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/reiterate#reiterate__4">reiterated</a> on Saturday that the management board had not violated its disclosure duties, and had decided to not inform investors earlier because they had failed to grasp the scope of the potential fines and penalties.</p>
<p>Citing documents unsealed by the Braunschweig prosecutor’s office, Der Spiegel said Diess was present at a meeting on July 27, 2015 when senior engineers and executives discussed how to deal with U.S. regulators, who were threatening to ban VW cars because of excessive pollution levels.</p>
<p>Diess, who was VW’s brand chief at the time, became chief executive of Volkswagen Group in April this year. Volkswagen also owns the Scania, Skoda, Audi, Porsche, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini and Ducati brands.</p>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had found unusually high pollution levels in VW’s vehicles and was threatening to <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/withhold?q=withhold+">withhold</a> road certification for new cars until VW explained why pollution levels were too high.</p>
<p>Diess, who had <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/defect_2">defected </a>from BMW to become head of the VW brand on July 1, 2015, joined the July 27 meeting with Volkswagen’s then Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn to discuss how to convince regulators that VW’s cars could be sold, a VW defense document filed with a court in Braunschweig in February, shows.</p>
<p>Volkswagen on Saturday said both Winterkorn and Diess declined to comment given the ongoing proceedings. A spokesman for Martin Winterkorn declined to comment on Saturday. Winterkorn’s lawyer Felix Doerr, could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Following this meeting, Winterkorn asked Diess whether BMW too had installed “defeat devices” in its cars, Der Spiegel said.</p>
<p>In the United States, legal engine management software is described as an “<a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/auxiliary_1?q=auxiliary">auxiliary </a>emissions device” while the term “defeat device” is used to describe only illegal software.</p>
<p>Diess is said to have answered that BMW had not made use of such software, Der Spiegel said.</p>
<p>EVALUATE</p>
<p>Volkswagen said on Saturday: “The contents of the discussion, where Martin Winterkorn and Herbert Diess were present, cannot be fully reconstructed, because the <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/recollection#recollection__4">recollections </a>of the people who were present partially <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/deviate?q=deviate">deviate</a>.”</p>
<p>Volkswagen further said it was the task of authorities and courts to evaluate the conflicting statements and to assess whether individual witnesses were <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/credible?q=credible">credible</a>.</p>
<p>Diess and Winterkorn left the July 27 meeting taking a presentation with them, Der Spiegel further said.</p>
<p>A VW employee intervened and cautioned the managers that it would be better if they were not in possession of the presentation, Der Spiegel said.</p>
<p>Volkswagen said on Saturday the purpose of the July 27 meeting was not to discuss whether Volkswagen had broken U.S. law, but how to resolve the issue of whether new models would be given regulatory clearance.</p>
<p>Volkswagen argued that it had struggled to understand whether its software was in fact illegal, the defense document filed with the Braunschweig court shows.</p>
<p>On July 31, 2015 Volkswagen hired a law firm to help the company understand its regulatory troubles, and lawyers were unsure whether the software would be <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/deem#deem__4">deemed</a> an illegal “defeat device” in the United States, VW said in the court filing.</p>
<p>The court filing further said that Hans Dieter Poetsch, Volkswagen’s finance chief at the time, on Sept. 14, 2015 believed the potential financial risk from regulatory penalties tied to emissions would be around 150 million euros ($172 million).</p>
<p>Hans Dieter Poetsch is now Volkswagen’s chairman.</p>
<p>Volkswagen on Saturday reiterated that it had not violated disclosure rules and had informed investors in a timely manner about the financial scope of the scandal when it published an “<a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/ad-hoc_1?q=hoc">ad hoc</a>” disclosure notice on Sept. 22, 2015.</p>
<p>Volkswagen said that although it had admitted to using defeat devices to regulators on Sept. 3, 2015 it had assumed that penalties would not exceed 200 million euros, based on the size of fines imposed against rival carmakers who had committed similar regulatory breaches.</p>
<p>Because the company had already <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/accrue#accrue__4">accrued </a>sufficient <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/provision_1#provision_1__11">provisions</a> for vehicle recalls to cover this amount, there was no need to inform investors that profits could take a further hit before September 2015, Volkswagen’s court filing said.</p>

<p><strong>#China Tower debut reveals costs of tech leadership</strong></p>
<p>HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China Tower’s <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/flotation?q=flotation+">flotation </a>shows the price of telecoms dominance. Shares of the infrastructure company opened flat in Hong Kong on Wednesday. The newly listed <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/entity?q=entity+">entity </a>commands a low valuation relative to its Western peers. It’s a <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/keen_1">keen </a>reminder of the cost of leading the global industry.</p>
<p>The company raised $6.9 billion from the initial public offering, giving it a roughly $28 billion market value. Stock was sold at a multiple of almost eight times its EBITDA in 2017. That’s a <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/steep_1?q=steep+">steep </a>discount to U.S. tower companies, American Tower and Crown Castle, which trade at nearer 22 times and 23 times <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/trail_2">trailing </a>EBITDA, according to Eikon.</p>
<p>Cheap valuations affect the rest of the industry too. The three state-backed carriers – China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom – trade on multiples below 3.5 times trailing EBITDA. By contrast, Verizon and T-Mobile are valued at around 7.1 and 7.8 times respectively, while Vodafone is less than six times.</p>
<p>The steep discounts are<u> in part</u> because Beijing wants the carriers to build out a world-beating 5G network, probably starting <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/earnest?q=earnest+">in earnest</a> around 2019. EY expects capital expenditure for the technology to reach 1.5 trillion yuan ($220 billion) between 2019 and 2025. The commercial <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/rationale?q=rationale+">rationale </a>is <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hazy?q=hazy">hazy</a>, and it’s uncertain if officials will allow companies to later charge consumers more to <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/recoup?q=recoup+">recoup </a>costs.</p>
<p>The concern for China Tower centres on its future <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/lease_1?q=lease+">lease </a>negotiations; current agreements expire in late 2022. The state-owned company may be strong-armed into cutting its exhausted customers – who also double as its part owners – a break on fees.</p>
<p>That’s what happened earlier this year when the most recent round of negotiations reduced costs for the carriers, shaving around 2.9 billion yuan ($425 million) off net income this year – more than forecast earnings of 2.2 billion yuan, Bernstein estimates.</p>
<p>It’s a reminder of the steep expense of China’s much-<a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/vaunted?q=vaunted+" >vaunted </a>ambition to lead in telecom technology. That prospect – and the security and commercial implications it might <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/entail?q=entail+">entail </a>– has <u>sent hearts racing</u> in Washington, New Delhi and elsewhere. China Tower investors may also feel their pulses quicken as the scope of that <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/endeavour_1?q=endeavour+" style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 10pt;">endeavour </a>becomes clear, <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/albeit?q=albeit+">albeit </a>for very different reasons.</p>
