sports- <span style="color: #800080;">baseball</span>- Blue Jays being run more like a political party than a baseball franchise
<blockquote>Instead of shouting it in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">midst</span> of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">tantrum</span>, he ought to have done it at a news conference.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Instead, what we get is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">hailstorm</span> of <span style="color: #ff0000;">buzzwords</span> and a generalized hopefulness for a better future.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Full credit to two Americans – club president MARK SHAPIRO, President and CEO, and general manager ROSE ATKINS, Jays GM – for mastering local <span style="color: #ff0000;">customs</span> so adeptly.
<p class="c-article-body__text">You do the dirty business up front – <span style="color: #ff0000;">jettison</span> your predecessor, <span style="color: #ff0000;">cleanse</span> the old guard and bring in a bunch of <span style="color: #ff0000;">cronies</span>. That will upset people, but in the usual <span style="color: #ff0000;">fray</span> of arrival it just might go <span style="color: #ff0000;">unremarked</span>. If it doesn’t, you’ve got ages to <span style="color: #ff0000;">live it down</span>.</p>
<p class="c-article-body__text">Having <span style="color: #ff0000;">scorched</span> the earth, your next move is to settle in for a nice, long period of doing nothing.</p>
<p class="c-article-body__text">Instead, talk about staying the <span style="color: #ff0000;">course </span>– even if the course is pointing you toward the edge of a waterfall... It makes you look <span style="color: #ff0000;">resolute</span>.</p>
<p class="c-article-body__text">Whatever you do, stay as <span style="color: #ff0000;">vague</span> as possible.</p>
<p class="c-article-body__text">Fans will spend the next while <span style="color: #ff0000;">obsessing</span> about the arrival of super-prospect Vlad Guerrero, Jr. (a player Shapiro and Atkins had nothing to do with acquiring).</p>
<p class="c-article-body__text">In 2020, if things break just right for <span style="color: #ff0000;">brass</span>, they might still be learning. Maybe they can give everyone glasses or make them read books in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dugout</span>.</p>
<p class="c-article-body__text">That’s when a whole bunch of money is <span style="color: #ff0000;">miraculously</span> discovered sitting around in an unused office.</p>
<p class="c-article-body__text">Refusing to admit something is not the same thing as <span style="color: #ff0000;">refuting</span> it.</p>
<p class="c-article-body__text">The word “rebuilding” has become a sort of <span style="color: #ff0000;">compliment</span>.</p>
<p class="c-article-body__text">Then again, having waited so long to give it a try, it might <span style="color: #ff0000;">enrage</span> them.</p>
<p class="c-article-body__text">The <span style="color: #ff0000;">irony</span> here is that this approach doesn’t buy you more time... A lot of wild <span style="color: #ff0000;">flopping</span> around at the end buys you a season or two more, but it eventually ends the same way.</p>
<p class="c-article-body__text">All the Parliament Hill approach does is <span style="color: #ff0000;">embolden</span> the next regime to go the same, overcalculated, overcautious route. Then you wake up one day and you haven’t made the <span style="color: #ff0000;">playoffs</span> in 20 years.</p>
