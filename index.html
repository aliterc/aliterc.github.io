8-18-2018-BUSINESS- VW's CEO was told about emissions software months before scandal: Der Spiegel</p>
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) Chief Executive Herbert Diess was told about the existence of cheating software in cars two months before regulators blew the whistle on a multi-billion <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/exhaust_1">exhaust</a> emissions scandal, German magazine Der Spiegel said.</p>
Der Spiegel’s story, based on recently unsealed documents from the Braunschweig prosecutor’s office, raises questions about whether VW informed investors <u>in a <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/timely?q=timely">timely</a> manner</u> about the scope of a scandal which it said has cost it more than $27 billion in penalties and fines.</p>

law- Tech firms should be made liable for 'fake news' on sites: UK lawmakers
<blockquote>LONDON (Reuters) - Tech firms like Facebook (<span id="”symbol_FB.O_0”" style="color: #800080;">FB.O</span>) should be made <span style="color: #ff0000;">liable</span> for “harmful and misleading” material on their websites and pay a <span style="color: #ff0000;">levy</span> so they can be regulated, British lawmakers said, warning of a crisis in democracy due to misuse of personal data.

Facebook executives said on Wednesday its <span style="color: #800080;">profit margin</span>s would <span style="color: #ff0000;">plummet</span> for several years due to the cost of improving privacy safeguards and slowing usage in its <span style="color: #800080;">top advertising markets</span>. The news wiped over $120 billion off the company’s <span style="color: #800080;">share price</span>.

At the same time, the company is coming under <span style="color: #ff0000;">concerted</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">regulatory</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">scrutiny</span> in Britain, the United States and the European Union.

“Companies like Facebook made it easy for developers to <span style="color: #ff0000;">scrape</span> user data and to deploy it in other campaigns without their knowledge or consent,” DAMIAN  Collins, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said in a statement officially released on Sunday.

The report was first published online late on Friday by DOMINIC CUMMINGS, who ran the officially <span style="color: #ff0000;">designated</span> Vote Leave campaign in the EU referendum.

The standards of accuracy and impartiality which tech companies are <span style="color: #ff0000;">held to</span> could be based on regulator Ofcom’s rules for television and radio, the lawmakers said.

“Sometimes decisions about what is and isn’t ‘fake’ will be highly political and <span style="color: #ff0000;">contentious</span>,” techUK’s deputy director, Antony Walker, said.

The committee’s report also suggested a levy on tech firms which could contribute to an increased budget for Britain’s data regulator, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), in the way in which the banking sector pays for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">upkeep</span> of its watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority.

“We are facing nothing less than a crisis in our democracy – based on the systematic manipulation of data to support the <span style="color: #ff0000;">relentless</span> targeting of citizens ... by campaigns of <span style="color: #ff0000;">disinformation</span> and messages of hate,” Collins said.</blockquote>

The complete story of Billy Yin 8-17-2018

<div><br>
</div>
<div><font color="#ffffff" style="background-color:rgb(11,83,148)">NOVEL</font></div>
<div>
<div>
<ul><li>China's property investment fastest in three-years, land shortage supports values</li></ul>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>BEIJING (Reuters) - China posted its fastest property investment growth in three years in the first quarter, driven by a surge in land values and as developers grew more confident about the policy outlook, however, sales slowed as existing curbs hit transactions.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Property investment grew 10.4 percent in January-March from the same period a year earlier, compared with a 9.9 percent rise in the first two months, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Tuesday. This matched the year-to-date growth seen in the January-February 2015 period, which was the fastest since the first-quarter of 2014.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Analysts say a significant rise in land prices, as well as local governments rushing to frontload public housing projects could have contributed to the boost in the headline figure.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>“Land prices have grown sharply since last year, contributing heavily to the total investment value,” said Yang Yewei, a Beijing-based analyst at Southwest Securities.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Yang added that China’s efforts to get rid of shanty towns — offering money and resettlement to squatters — sped up notably in the first quarter, also resulting in higher investment values.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Total land transaction values rose 20.3 percent in the first three months of the year from a year earlier, the data showed. Over the same period, total land purchased only rose 0.5 percent.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>China’s central government controls land supply and the rapid urbanization process has seen available construction land dwindle in recent years.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>While the amount of land local governments are entitled to sell remains relatively stable, the country’s biggest cities, such as the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, have struggled with a supply shortage.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Other analysts note developers are incentivised to restock as inventories fall and market sentiment in smaller cities remains strong. Official data shows the amount of unsold completed homes has fallen 16.7 percent by end-march from a year earlier.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Real estate directly affects 40 other business sectors in China and is a major driver for the economy. But a boom since 2016 has raised bubble concerns and prompted a flurry of government measures to tame soaring home prices.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Chinese policymakers are seeking to engineer a soft landing without roiling the economy as a sharp decline in prices and investment would weigh on industrial activity and dampen consumer confidence.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>They might be house owners, but not land owners. Land owners were really rich guys. But once yo become a house owner, you might have some assets you could profit from. It took three to nighteen years' work to afford the deposite of a house. Not to say, unemployment rate is sometimes very high.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>This part of the country was very cheap. It was mountain region and remote.&nbsp;</div>

<div><br>
</div>
<div>Land buying is an old business. Chinese would like ancester worship to be an excuse to buy some land with a family temple and private education house on it,to save as their raning fund.&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<font face="georgia, serif" size="5"><span style="background-color:transparent"><b>Let me tell you something -2 /2</b></span></font></div>
<div><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="background-color:transparent"><br>
</span></font></div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif" size="4"><span style="background-color:transparent">Mr Tunnel finally ended up in his big house. He felt that enemies were aournd and he was leaving the world. After a long walk in the countryside, Billy Yin felt healthier, awaken and relaxed. Things bothered him in the city suddenly disappeared. He definitely was thinking of him every minute. He decided that they would not have a child. So, he said to him, who was an image in the white space in the reflection of a train's window, let me love you, I will put all my love belonging to the baby, on you.</span>
</font></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif" size="4">Billy Yin could drive. He didn't have a car. He didn't need a car as public transport were so advanced in China. I will wait. He thought like this. Who will be waiting, as you are going back to the prison where you were born. It didn't feel like a prison. People were getting rich and complaining prices of everything. 3/4 of the people were ruling class, while 1/4 of the people were working class. If a Chinese was operating a business, he should pay 40% of his profit as tax. For foreign companies, it went to 60%. While, the rest were public servants, state companies and communist party members. The 1/4 were enjoying freedom.</font></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif" size="4">Billy Yin had a master degree from Cardiff University. He studied in media research. His parents were medium size business owners. Deep in the woods, ghosts were approaching his house. Some figures in Japanese paintings were threatening Mr Tunnel. He was lonely, easy to get angry, hard to be satisfied and fond of revenge. When bar fighting had become so frequent, he chose to shut himself in. He had been not like this. When he was still a happy man, he was loved by students. He was lovely, gentle and kind. After he finished his doctor degree, he suddenly abandoned his Christian principles, became greedy, started dating Asian boys.</font></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif" size="4">Billy Yin needed a deep pocket to get out. Jeff Tunnel needed a doctor to get out of his house.</font></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif" size="4">Billy Yin was a loyal good wife kind of young man. He knew about tea making, flower arrangement and could play traditional Chinese instrument. He was absolutely 'refined'. He treated Mr Tunnel as a husband and was absolutely willing to do all his landuaries, being his maid, male friend, mental health doctor, puppet, TED, and cook. Two men lived together. They must be very good friends and 'cool guys'.</font></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif" size="4">Tears, tears, afternoon sunshine already made Mr Tunnel tears down near his second floor room's window. He was tired and needed coffee. His lifestyle was flourish. After meeting lots of strangers, he felt so lonely. He shouldn't be thinking of having a foreign partner in his house, but actually, he was thinking of having one decent eastern style tamed guy who could treat him as a young master.</font></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif" size="4">God forbad it as they were not in an equal relationship. For British who married a foreign partner, there could be an income requirement for the partner to stay. Billy Yin had been in the industry of financial product felling for years. He was still fearing that he could be fired at any moment because of incompentance. He treated a day as two days; and even though the time had been doubly tight, he could not submit a loose copy for every work. The manager gave him a task paper and would check at the end of the day. Getting up at 7 a.m.,returning home by 8 p.m.,he would wash himself, read more BOOKS, and waited for another working day.</font></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif" size="4">Billy Yin's elder sister was working for state media, CCTV channel.</font></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif" size="4">Shanghai was a city for light meals, which means office works were the majority. Deep in Billy Yin's heart, he wanted a have a free 24h English speaking person around and a 'quick' access to a British passport. He found that days were long, money were not easy to be earned, Chinese was sometimes a foreign language, people were thinking themselves as the greatest but it was hard for them to know or give themselves a real position to be. He has seen the world. He couldn't accept the place where 3/4 people were praying on another 1/4. Public servants were not faithful to communist belief; state companies were not faithful communist believers; the communists themselves didn't give up just because they couldn't know what to do for a China without them. If all their interests, stable life and benefits would not be touched, they won't care who is in charge. As long as their money comes in, they would welcome every new idea. Like many of his uncles, the last generation, Billy Yin was smart to just complain to himself. Yin would always be frightened when he found his wages couldn't leave any savings.</font></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif" size="4">Billy Yin was experiencing the worst of what big cities could bring: lies under the glory of fame. For developing countries, lcal companies wanted to be crowned with big brands and pretened to be strong and famous. So they lied in their recruiting fliers, websites. So they could bring more gulliable people to their call center.</font></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif" size="4">Billy Yin's mother died of kidney failure. His father died of heart failure. His sister had been regularly treated for a kind of incurable disease. He was definitely on his own after his graduation from the U.K. on his father's death.</font></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif" size="4">He was from northeast China. In his blog, he wrote:</font></div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif"><br>
</font></div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif" size="4">"I was spoiled by my parents and families. I'm young and needed money and a man who treat me well."</font></div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif"><br>
</font></div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif" size="4">He was a sweet heart man. But Asian culture is full of bitterness.</font></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif" size="4">Weekend.</font></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif" size="4">He really wanted to sleep with someone. He got crush on men often. Due to distress from work he needed release. He prepared a hot bath, he wanted it to be shared by another one.</font></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><font face="georgia, serif" size="4">There was a mountain in Beijing. It was the edge of the town, dividing farmers from town people. Always, it had been a good place to climb and walk to get some silence, protection, privacy, oxigy, and excersise. It had also been a military way. Mr Tunnel's tree house was in the middle of woods.</font></div>
<div>
<hr>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<ul><li>I got very ill. DM came to hospital to look after me during the night. He got very hungry and I got very hungry too during the night. He went out to buy some snacks. I texted him: I need food, proper food, no chocolate bar, no crisp, I need food.&nbsp;</li></ul>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>He texted back: You bitch, I'm eating biscuits in a Tesco. What do you want?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I texted back: Water, please. I can't eat anything actually.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>He texted back: OK, I go back home to make you some Kong pao chicken with rice. Just chicken breast meat. It should be OK with your treatment.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I texted back: Hot food. Make it hot.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>After 40 minutes, I was having classic Chinese dish: Kong pao chicken (no spice) rice. Neighbour hated me to wake them up.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The next day, I vomitted out all the food, continued to the strict hospital food. I had to pay 80 pounds for the cleaner to clean the mess.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>With little nutrient, I got weaker and slimer. When people have no shelter, they eat biscuits. When people are paying the house loan, they eat biscuits. When people are sick, they eat biscuits. When people want to just eat but don't want actually to get anything from the food, they eat biscuits.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Our little house in Scotland was empty and I chose to move from hospital in Newcastle to our home. I have a child. I have a child.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>God, please save me. I'm so weak. Yet, I feel the eagerness to live.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>DM's money was very tight. He had been a student on a research which needed travel a lot. He told me he loved every kind of dicounts and sales. He could find half priced snacks from very poorly decorated Muslim or Indian shops. He bought lots of pickles with his rice.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I joked: in Britain you see real poor people.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>He didn't have a job. His only choice was to cut the spending. When he put his penis into my body, I could feel his being careful and in a disadvantage because of financial status.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I'm on my own.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>My lover was young. My friends were far away. My job was 'on vocation to Australia this semester'. I didn't want to give up.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>It would be a medical miracle. Strongly, my belief on Christian had been growing. I dreamt a lot about things from childhood to student life to work. Dreams were messing up pieces of my memory and doubts. I hadn't remembered lots of instructions from teachers, but got useless details from life. I had solved lots of my doubts and questions on my bed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I had a medical doctor degree. I saw myself in front a door. I couldn't get through it, or bring anyone dead to live again. I had been very cautious and careful with my work so I deserved the payment. I didn't need to be careful any more in my final days as I was more and more like a child needing mum. I needed my mother. I wanted a woman to hug me and forever. I had been successful at feeding myself, making myself healthy as much as possible and happened to have managed to be a kind person. But I felt lost, even I had made the great gay escape.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>DM was not a church I should value. He was not a husband or a wife. He had been filthy, childish and stupid. He would be the dirt if god judged me.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Then I began to keep distance from the kid. I must want to sleep with a Bible. Wierd.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
