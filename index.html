<p class="c-article-body__text">You do the dirty business up front – <span style="color: #ff0000;">jettison</span> your predecessor, <span style="color: #ff0000;">cleanse</span> the old guard and bring in a bunch of <span style="color: #ff0000;">cronies</span>. That will upset people, but in the usual <span style="color: #ff0000;">fray</span> of arrival it just might go <span style="color: #ff0000;">unremarked</span>.

<p class="c-article-body__text">Having <span style="color: #ff0000;">scorched</span> the earth, your next move is to settle in for a nice, long period of doing nothing.</p>

law- Tech firms should be made liable for 'fake news' on sites: UK lawmakers
<blockquote>LONDON (Reuters) - Tech firms like Facebook (<span id="”symbol_FB.O_0”" style="color: #800080;">FB.O</span>) should be made <span style="color: #ff0000;">liable</span> for “harmful and misleading” material on their websites and pay a <span style="color: #ff0000;">levy</span> so they can be regulated, British lawmakers said, warning of a crisis in democracy due to misuse of personal data.

Facebook executives said on Wednesday its <span style="color: #800080;">profit margin</span>s would <span style="color: #ff0000;">plummet</span> for several years due to the cost of improving privacy safeguards and slowing usage in its <span style="color: #800080;">top advertising markets</span>. The news wiped over $120 billion off the company’s <span style="color: #800080;">share price</span>.

At the same time, the company is coming under <span style="color: #ff0000;">concerted</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">regulatory</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">scrutiny</span> in Britain, the United States and the European Union.

“Companies like Facebook made it easy for developers to <span style="color: #ff0000;">scrape</span> user data and to deploy it in other campaigns without their knowledge or consent,” DAMIAN  Collins, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said in a statement officially released on Sunday.

The report was first published online late on Friday by DOMINIC CUMMINGS, who ran the officially <span style="color: #ff0000;">designated</span> Vote Leave campaign in the EU referendum.

The standards of accuracy and impartiality which tech companies are <span style="color: #ff0000;">held to</span> could be based on regulator Ofcom’s rules for television and radio, the lawmakers said.

“Sometimes decisions about what is and isn’t ‘fake’ will be highly political and <span style="color: #ff0000;">contentious</span>,” techUK’s deputy director, Antony Walker, said.

The committee’s report also suggested a levy on tech firms which could contribute to an increased budget for Britain’s data regulator, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), in the way in which the banking sector pays for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">upkeep</span> of its watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority.

“We are facing nothing less than a crisis in our democracy – based on the systematic manipulation of data to support the <span style="color: #ff0000;">relentless</span> targeting of citizens ... by campaigns of <span style="color: #ff0000;">disinformation</span> and messages of hate,” Collins said.</blockquote>
